# Study Management

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to manage Systematic Searches in your SyRF project. Study Management is where project administrators upload, organize, monitor, and maintain study references throughout the systematic review process.

## What is Study Management?

In SyRF, Systematic Searches are organized groups of references from your database searches (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, etc.).

The Study Management interface provides tools to:

- Upload new systematic searches
- Monitor upload and processing progress
- Update existing study data in bulk
- Calculate Risk of Bias assessments
- Manage PDF file associations
- Delete systematic searches when needed

## Accessing Study Management

{: .note }
> **Administrator Access Required:** Study Management features are only available to project administrators.

Navigate to **Studies** ‚Üí **Study Management** in your project to access the administrative interface.

## The Study Management Interface

The Study Management page contains four main sections:

### 1. Systematic Searches Table
Your primary workspace showing all uploaded searches with:
- **Action buttons**: Upload new searches and bulk update studies
- **Search list**: View all systematic searches with status, study counts, and actions
- **Bulk operations**: Select multiple searches for Risk of Bias calculations
- **Progress indicators**: Real-time status updates with clickable links to detailed progress

For each systematic search, manage viewing, deletion, Risk of Bias calculations, and ID copying.

### 2. Risk of Bias Assessment Monitoring
Track automated bias assessment jobs with detailed progress and error reporting.

### 3. Job Progress Monitoring  
Real-time tracking of background processes including Systematic Serach Uploads, Bulk Study Updates with comprehensive error details.
