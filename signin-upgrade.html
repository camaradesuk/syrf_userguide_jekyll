  <h1>Sign In System - Important Changes</h1>
  <h3>4th May 2022</h3>
  <p>
    We have upgraded SyRF’s Sign In System. As part of this upgrade, you are required to set a new password.

        When signing in to SyRF the application will take you to a new welcome landing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you can select whether you wish to sign in using either:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An email & password by entering your email address and pressing 'Continue'.</li>
        <li>Sign in using a social sign-in. E.g. Google by pressing 'Continue with Google'.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Users who sign in using an email & password</h2>
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <div class="side-by-side">
      <p>
        You will be required to reset your password. Your new password should contain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At least 8 characters</li>
        <li>At least 3 of the following:
          <ul>
            <li> Lower case letters (a-z)</li>
            <li>Upper case letters (A-Z)</li>
            <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
            <li>Special characters (ex. !@~$%^&*)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the ‘Enter your password’ page click on the ‘Forgot your password?’. This will send you an email with a link
        to reset your password.
      </p>

        After your first time authenticating with your social sign-in (e.g. Google) you will be required to re-link your
        social sign-in to your SyRF account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the instructions under ‘Existing SyRF account’ making sure you enter the email already associated with
        your SyRF account.
