# Calculate Risk of Bias

This guide covers how to initiate and monitor Risk of Bias assessments for your systematic searches in SyRF.

## Running Risk of Bias Assessment

To start a Risk of Bias assessment on a search, use the checkboxes in the first column of the Systematic Searches table. You can select a single search, multiple searches, or all searches. When you make a selection, you will see a button with text that shows the number of selected studies (e.g., "2 selected"). Click this button to access the risk of bias assessment options:

![Risk Of Bias 3](/figs/Fig_Risk-Of-Bias-3.png){: style="border: 2px solid #ccc; padding:10px;"}

Click the button that shows the number of selected searches (e.g., "2 selected" in the screenshot):
![Risk Of Bias 1](/figs/Fig_Risk-Of-Bias-1.png){: style="border: 2px solid #ccc; padding:10px;"}

Now click "Calculate Risk of Bias for Selected" to start the process:
![Risk Of Bias 2](/figs/Fig_Risk-Of-Bias-2.png){: style="border: 2px solid #ccc; padding:10px;"}

Alternatively, you can use the ellipsis menu at the end of each row to start the risk of bias calculation:
![Risk Of Bias 4](/figs/Fig_Risk-Of-Bias-4.png){: style="border: 2px solid #ccc; padding:10px;"}
