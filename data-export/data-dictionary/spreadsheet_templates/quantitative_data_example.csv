Tizabi,,Psychopharmacology (Berl),"""RATIONALE: A number of preclinical and clinical studies suggest that ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has a rapid and lasting antidepressant effect when administered either acutely or chronically. It has been postulated that this effect is due to stimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether AMPA alone has an antidepressant effect and if the combination of AMPA and ketamine provides added benefit in Wistar-Kyoto rats, a putative animal model of depression. RESULTS: Chronic AMPA treatment resulted in a dose-dependent antidepressant effect in both the forced swim test and sucrose preference test. Moreover, chronic administration (10-11 days) of combinations of AMPA and ketamine, at doses that were ineffective on their own, resulted in a significant antidepressant effect. The behavioral effects were associated with increases in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, synapsin, and mammalian target of rapamycin. CONCLUSION: These findings are the first to provide evidence for an antidepressant effect of AMPA and suggest the usefulness of AMPA-ketamine combination in treatment of depression.

METHODS: Male HCN1 knock out (HCN1-/- ) and wildtype (HCN1+/+ ) C57BL6 mice (8-12 weeks, 20-25 g) were chosen. The depression model of mice was developed by continuously oral administration of low dosage of corticosterone (CORT). The immobility time in forced swimming tests (FST) was used to assess the depressive state of mice. Then the two genotype depressive mice were treated with single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg ketamine (KET group, n=7) or same volume of normal saline (NS group, n=7) respectively. After treatment, the immobility time at 30 min, 24 h and 7 d after the intraperitoneal injection of ketamine or normal saline in CORT-treated mice were compared. In addition, normal HCN1-/- and HCN1+/+ mice were intraperitoneally injected of BrdU and then treated with 5 mg/kg ketamine (KET group, n=5) or same volume of normal saline (NS group, n= 5) by single intraperitoneal injection. Each group was euthanized for immunohistochemical processing of 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells in hippocampus at 24 h after the intraperitoneal injection of saline or ketamine.

However, the extent and duration of the antidepressant effect over longer periods of time has not been considered. This study evaluated the effects of single dose of ketamine on behavior and oxidative stress, which is related to depression, in the brains of adult rats subjected to maternal deprivation. Deprived and nondeprived Wistar rats were divided into four groups nondeprived+saline; nondeprived+S-ketamine (15 mg/kg); deprived+saline; deprived+S-ketamine (15 mg/kg). A single dose of ketamine or saline was administrated during the adult phase, and 14 days later depressive-like behavior was assessed. In addition, lipid damage, protein damage, and antioxidant enzyme activities were evaluated in the rat brain. Maternal deprivation induces a depressive-like behavior, as verified by an increase in immobility and anhedonic behavior. However, a single dose of ketamine was able to reverse these alterations, showing long-term antidepressant effects. The brains of maternally deprived rats had an increase in protein oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation, but administration of a single dose of ketamine reversed this damage.

Zhang and J. J. Yang""",,Ups.J.Med.Sci.,"""INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients and in animal models of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms are not totally understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute administration of different doses of ketamine on the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test (FST) and to determine levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 each): group saline and groups ketamine 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg. On the first day, all animals were forced to swim for 15 min. On the second day ketamine (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, respectively) was given intraperitoneally, at 30 min before the second episode of the forced swimming test. Immobility times of the rats during the forced swimming test were recorded. The animals were then decapitated. The hippocampus was harvested for determination of BDNF and mTOR levels. RESULTS: Compared with group saline, administration of ketamine at a dose of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg decreased the duration of immobility (P < 0.05 for all doses). Ketamine at doses of both 10 and 15 mg/kg showed a significant increase in the expression of hippocampal BDNF (P < 0.05 for both doses).

These findings suggest that global blockade of NMDARs in developmentally mature hippocampal synapses are required for the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine""",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25520615,,2014,,c4a305eb-d74f-4998-b318-953e980935e4,60040,Nosyreva-2014-Age dependence of the rapid anti.pdf,,23/02/2023 11:28,51cf0ef9-5dd5-48fc-bb08-c1c0447cae8f,2,FALSE,09ab5125-36c9-41c2-9b45-94169c7a41a6,Lucas O'Connor,Not Reported ,Not Reported ,Yes ,24/07/2023 13:21,796be197-1725-41ed-8c3f-1a18cfdb3626,FST Immobility,3304946c-1a5e-46ff-badb-d7745638087c,FST/Ket,10,FALSE,f9d8b31d-6172-4053-bc4f-ce8a14d456b5,FST,FALSE,90de4c42-5a5f-4a27-b0a6-3a955535e109,Ketamine 3mg,383d6c37-bef3-4094-8354-70630803bdf5,FST Immobility,TRUE,24,79.65,mean,seconds,11.49,SD

Xavier""",,Neurochem.Res.,"""Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an important health problem that is often associated to stress. One of the main brain regions related to MDD is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic center, part of the reward and motivation circuitry. Recent studies show that changes to VTA dopaminergic neurons are associated with depression and treatment. Ketamine has recently shown a fast, potent antidepressant effect in acute, sub-anesthetic doses. Thus, our aims were to elucidate if ketamine would be able to revert depression-like behaviors induced by a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol and if it could cause alterations to metabolism and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactivity in VTA. For this, 48 Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control + saline (CTRL + SAL), control + ketamine (CTRL + KET), CUS + saline (CUS + SAL), CUS + ketamine (CUS + KET). The CUS groups underwent 28 days of CUS protocol. Saline or ketamine (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitonially once on day 28. The behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test, the open field test, and the forced swim test. Glucose brain metabolism was assessed and quantified with microPET. TH-immunoreactivity was assessed by estimating neuronal density and regional and cellular optical densities. A decrease in sucrose intake in the CUS groups and an increase in immobility was rapidly reverted by ketamine (p < 0.05). No difference was observed in the open field test. There was no alteration to VTA metabolism and TH-immunoreaction. These results suggest that the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS and the antidepressant effects of ketamine are unrelated to changes in neuronal metabolism or dopamine production in VTA""",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25894683,,2015,,1e603c82-ac0f-4031-b28b-cd2709f4c094,30862,Baptista-2015-Antidepressant Effects of Ketami.pdf,,23/02/2023 11:28,51cf0ef9-5dd5-48fc-bb08-c1c0447cae8f,2,FALSE,09ab5125-36c9-41c2-9b45-94169c7a41a6,Lucas O'Connor,Not Reported ,Not Reported ,Yes ,24/07/2023 14:10,b5efd39a-6ff7-4204-af78-2c2c46e6569b,FST,ec7c27df-c0c9-43f3-8fef-97668b17e4cc,Control/FST/Sal,12,TRUE,c5f67272-a04d-4cf8-b032-4edaea942ec0,Control,TRUE,f0f3eaa0-2974-4aa6-89b5-2ff678d02c69,Saline,4b42b4dc-b66a-4d3b-9f1c-27b1fd220821,FST Immobility,TRUE,16,36.93,mean,seconds,5.49,SD

CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that ketamine confers antidepressant effects in an animal model of pediatric depression""",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191502,,2014,,470adab5-6f53-44ea-956d-74d1679b9559,30171,Li-2014-Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine on.pdf,,23/02/2023 11:28,51cf0ef9-5dd5-48fc-bb08-c1c0447cae8f,2,FALSE,09ab5125-36c9-41c2-9b45-94169c7a41a6,Lucas O'Connor,Not Reported ,Not Reported ,Yes ,24/07/2023 14:41,5048e492-3d66-41ed-8d94-0d67b3b6a56a,FST,4d2abada-9c48-4617-b33f-7c4073842070,DEX/FST/Ket,9,FALSE,91649c37-37b7-4047-a05f-fb7ea15774ab,DEX,FALSE,fa40fc5f-3924-4fbe-a5d9-81a8722ab69e,Ketamine 10,9b92b619-ed1f-4bb2-9a1f-bfaf2a45fbc5,FST Immobility,TRUE,46,13.29,mean,seconds,4.87,SD
