Ma;R. Song;Y. Gao;Z. Liu,Life Sci,Life Sci,"The present study was performed to investigate the effects of Cd exposure on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction and to explore the role of mitophagy in Cd-induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism in chicken embryo liver tissues and hepatocytes. To this end, seven-day-old chicken embryos were exposed to different concentrations of Cd for 7 days, and primary chicken embryo hepatocytes were treated with Cd at four different concentrations for 6 h. Furthermore, the mitophagy inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was used to investigate the role of mitophagy in Cd-induced disruption of lipid metabolism. Lipid accumulation, the expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitophagy were measured. The results demonstrated that Cd exposure increases hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation and the expression levels of lipogenic genes while decreasing those of lipolytic genes. Furthermore, Cd exposure was observed to alter mitochondrial morphology in terms of reduced size, excessive mitochondrial damage, and the formation of mitophagosomes. The co-localization of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 and LC3 puncta was significantly increased in primary chicken embryo hepatocytes after Cd exposure. Moreover, Cd exposure increased LC3, PINK1, and Parkin protein expression levels. CsA effectively alleviated Cd-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, blocked mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, and suppressed PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Furthermore, CsA treatment reversed the Cd-induced TG accumulation in liver tissues but further increased it in hepatocytes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate (for the first time) the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway in Cd-induced disruption of lipid metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478761,"Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China; Poultry Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225125, PR China.Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-Product Safety of the Ministry of Education of China, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China.Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-Product Safety of the Ministry of Education of China, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, PR China.

Hua;W. Ye;K. Liu;T. Yun;Y. Zhu;C. Zhang,Virus Res,Virus Res,"Duck enteritis virus (DEV) can cause an acute, contagious and lethal disease of many species of waterfowl. An infectious bacterial artificial chromosome clone of DEV vaccine strain pE1 (pDEV-EF1) has been constructed in our previous study. Based on pE1, a recombinant mutated clone pDL (pVP26CFP-gCRFP), which carries a red fluorescent protein (mRFP) gene fused to the viral envelope protein gC in combination with a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) gene fused to the viral capsid VP26, was constructed by two-step Red/ET recombination and the recombinant virus rDL (rVP26CFP-gCRFP) was rescued from chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) by calcium phosphate transfection. Western blot analysis revealed that VP26-CFP and gC-mRFP were both expressed in fusion forms in rDL-infected CEFs, and subcellular localization study showed that gC-mRFP was mainly localized in whole cell at 36, 48 h post infection (p.i.); and then mostly migrated to the cytoplasm after 60 h.p.i., ; whereas VP26-CFP was localized in the nucleus in all stages of virus infection. Additionally, viral particles at different stages of morphogenesis (A capsids, B capsids, C capsids) were observed in virus-infected cells by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that exogenous gene insertion has no effect on virus assembly.

Fujimoto;H. Inoue;T. Kanda;M. Ijiri;R. Uemura,Avian Dis,Avian Dis,"Colibacillosis, an infectious disease of chickens, is caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC); however, in addition to APEC, other pathogens are also frequently isolated from chickens affected with colibacillosis. Therefore, experimental infections in chickens are necessary to evaluate the pathogenicity of APEC isolates. Recent studies have shown that embryo lethality assays can be used as an alternative method to evaluate the pathogenicity of E. coli. In this study, to determine the important virulence genes associated with the pathogenicity of E. coli, 67 strains of E. coli that possessed different combinations of eight representative virulence genes (cva/cvi, vat, tsh, iucD, papC, irp2, iss, and astA) were isolated from broilers with colibacillosis in Japan, and the chicken embryo lethal assay was conducted. The genes vat, papC, and irp2 showed strong correlation with the level of virulence in E. coli.

The healthy Roman grey laying hens with similar body mass and laying rate were selected as the testing objects. All hens were fed with corn-soybean meal-based diets for 7 d and then assigned to corn-soybean meal-based diets containing 0 (as the control group), 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1.0% bioactive selenium for 35 d, respectively. The results showed that: 1) When compared with the control group, there were no significant differences in production performance as dietary bioactive selenium contents increasing from 0.6% to 1.0% (P＞0.05). 2) When compared with the control group, no remarkable differences in eggshell thickness, eggshell strength, egg yolk mass and Haugh unit were observed among all the bioactive selenium-added groups (P＞0.05). In general, the thick albumen height increased in the 0.6% to 1.0% bioactive selenium groups on 7 and 21 d. Meanwhile, a significant increase of yolk percentage in bioactive selenium groups was observed relative to the control group on 28 d (P＜0.05). 3) The selenium content in the egg yolk increased linearly with the increase of dietary bioactive selenium contents (P＜0.05).

Reddy;Prasanna Babu Araveti;Dakshayani Lomada;Anand Srivastava;Madhava C. Reddy;Kakarla Raghava Reddy,Journal of Molecular Structure,Journal of Molecular Structure,"Cancer has a significant impact on public health around the world. Treating cancer by chemotherapy or radiotherapy has several side effects. In combinational cancer therapy, combining nanoparticles with chemotherapeutic and/or natural agents increases the synergistic therapeutic effects by reducing undesired side effects. In the pharmaceutical field, the use of quercetin was limited due to its partial solubility in aqueous solutions. Titanium dioxide nanotubes (TNT) have a higher surface area for carrier molecules with unique physical and chemical characteristics. We investigated the effect of quercetin, TNT, or conjugated TNT with quercetin (TNT–Qu) on the B16F10 murine melanoma model and two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model using 7, 12-Dimethylbenz (a) anthracene as a tumor initiator and Phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate as a tumor promoter. The topical application of TNT–Qu enhanced the anti-tumor activity in comparison to quercetin or TNT alone. TNT–Qu treatment to the tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced the tumor growth than quercetin or TNT alone treatment. TNT–Qu inhibited tumor growth by regulating phospho-STAT3 levels in the tumor microenvironment. In the two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model, TNT–Qu treatment has no effect on skin color and delayed the mortality rate in tumor-bearing mice. The histopathological data supports that TNT–Qu treatment exhibited reduced squamous cell carcinoma and ameliorated to a large extent with very low epidermal hyperplasia compared with quercetin or TNT alone. TNT–Qu treatment restored the γδ T cells levels to the normal skin level. Furthermore, TNT–Qu significantly inhibited the blood vessel formation in chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. TNT conjugated with quercetin could thus be a promising combinational molecule for effectively treating skin cancer.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000709963600010,,2022,10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131556,Journal Article,,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

Miserez,Acta Biomater,Acta Biomater,"A short bioinspired octapeptide, GV8, can self-assemble under mild conditions into biodegradable supramolecular physical hydrogels with high storage modulus and good biocompatibility. GV8 hydrogels can encapsulate both single or multiple macromolecular protein-based therapeutics in a simple one-pot formulation manner, making it a promising candidate to address challenges faced by existing synthetic polymer or peptide hydrogels with complex gelation and drug-encapsulation processes. Alongside its versatility, the hydrogel exhibits concentration-dependent storage modulus and controlled drug-release action. We demonstrate that GV8 hydrogels loaded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) secretome remain mechanically robust, and exhibit promising potential for wound healing applications by preserving secretome activity while maintaining a constant supply of ADMSC secretome to promote epithelial cell migration. Overall, our work highlights the potential of GV8 peptide hydrogel as a versatile and safe carrier for encapsulation and delivery of macromolecular therapeutics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Supramolecular peptide hydrogels are a popular choice for protein-based macromolecular therapeutics delivery; however, despite the development of abundant hydrogel systems, several challenges limit their adaptability and practical applications. GV8 short peptide hydrogel circumvents these drawbacks and demonstrates the ability to function as a versatile growth factor (GF) encapsulant. It can encapsulate precise concentrations of complex adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells secretome mixtures with a one-pot formulation approach and perform controlled release of GFs with preserved activity without compromising the self-assembly and mechanical properties of the hydrogel's supramolecular network. The significance of GV8 hydrogel lies in its gelation simplicity and versatility to encapsulate and deliver macromolecular therapeutics, thus representing a promising biomaterial for regenerative medicine applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551327,"Center for Sustainable Materials (SusMat), School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798.

Al-Masoudi,Biochemical and Cellular Archives,Biochemical and Cellular Archives,"Newcastle disease (ND) is considered a highly transmissible viral disease among birds, especially poultry and it spreads all over the world and causes great losses in the poultry production. Although, vaccines can be used as a way to control the disease, so far there is no approved anti-virus drug for ND. The aim of this study was to evaluate licorice root oil as an antiviral to Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The LaSota strain of NDV was incubated with licorice root oil for one hour and twenty four hours, after which its antiviral activity was measured by performing blood agglutination and RT-PCR tests. Toxicity of licorice root oil was determined by injection into developing chicken embryos with or without the virus. The results revealed that the oil played an effective role in reducing the effectiveness of the virus by destroying the receptors on the viral surface in addition to the inhibition of genet amplification compared to the control group treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) only, which gave opposite results. Also, there was no evidence of toxicity seen on the organism as the embryos injected with the oil alone or the oil treated with the virus were in good condition and very similar to those that were not inoculated with anything. In comparison, the injected embryos with the virus only showed signs of disease that did not appear in the other oil-containing groups. These findings show that licorice root oil is a strong potential antiviral agent and can play a role in the elimination of the disease.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015982299&from=export,"M.M.

Morrow,Avian Dis,Avian Dis,"Efforts to breed Attwater's prairie chickens (APC; Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) in captivity to supplement wild populations of this endangered bird have been negatively affected by infections with Avipoxvirus and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). Because REV can be integrated into the genome of fowlpox virus (FPV) and may be transmitted in that manner, identifying the source of avipox disease in APC is important to mitigate the impact of this virus. Tissue samples from APC were collected from breeding programs in Texas from 2016 to 2020. These samples consisted of 11 skin lesions and three internal organs from a total of 14 different birds that died of unknown causes or were euthanized. Avipoxvirus was detected by PCR and isolation in embryonating chicken eggs in all skin lesion samples but was not detected in internal organs. Using sequence analysis of FPV polymerase and 4b genes, we determined that 10 out of 11 Avipoxvirus detections resided within the fowlpox clade and a single sample resided within the canarypox clade. REV sequences were detected in all FPV positive samples and in all internal organ tissues but were not detected in the sample matching the canarypox clade. Analysis of REV sequences and PCR detection showed the REV infecting APC was consistent with REV-A and had little variability on analysis of the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. The results of this study indicate control of REV in APC breeding colonies may benefit by a vaccination program targeting FPV and REV.

Chen,Gen Comp Endocrinol,Gen Comp Endocrinol,"Feather pecking is a typically abnormal behavior that significantly impacts breeding efficiency and animal welfare in the egg production sector. Serotonin (5-HT) is essential for neuronal development and behavioral regulation. This study evaluated the effects of birds' behavioral development (including feather pecking) and changes in serum hormones in chickens followed in ovo injection of 5-HT. On day 11, incubated eggs were injected with 5-HT at 0 (saline control), 5 ug (low) or 15 ug (high) (n = 166 per treatment). The hatched female chicks were raised under similar conditions up to 20 weeks of age (n = 60 per treatment). Birds' behaviors were recorded using a digital video recording system. The time to first vocalize and first move, along with the duration of vocalization and escape attempts during the isolation test, during isolation test were analyzed on day 1, and week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20. Blood samples were collected followed behavioral tests (n = 5/treatment). The expression of 5-HTR1A genes in the hypothalamus was measured by real-time PCR. Compared to controls, 5-HT administrated pullets had greater body weight (P < 0.05) with an improved feed conversion rate (P < 0.05) as well as higher serum concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) regardless of their doses. In addition, serum dopamine (DA) concentrations were lower in both high- and low-dose pullets at 8 and 12 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Also, a decrease in fearfulness response was observed based on the test to vocalize and duration of vocalization (P < 0.05). Further, this exhibited a lesser frequency of total aggressive behavior compared with the chicks in the control group, especially at 8 weeks of age (P < 0.05), where it is associated with elevated serum 5-HT concentration and upregulated hypothalamic expression of 5-HTR1A (P < 0.05). The changes of these hormone concentrations and gene expressions suggested that 5-HT accumulation in early embryonic stages may alter both the adrenergic and serotonergic systems, which could further regulate the isolation behavior and improve birds' growth performance to a certain extent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048728,"College of Animal Science and Technology, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, Hebei 071001, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, Hebei 071001, China.

In the current study, AVEO nanoemulsion (AVEO-NE) was synthesized using an ultrasound-based emulsification method and its cytotoxic, apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-angiogenic properties were evaluated for the MCF-7 cancer cell line by measuring the cell’s gene expression profile and performing MTT. Finally, the anti-angiogenic activity of AVEO-NE was verified by applying CAM assay analysis. The results showed that AVEO-NE exhibited significant cell-selective cytotoxic, apoptotic, and antioxidant activities by up-regulating Cas-9, CAT, and SOD gene expression. Moreover, the AVEO-NE meaningfully suppressed angiogenesis in MCF-7 cancer cells by down-regulating VEGF gene expression.

Experiments with biological model systems currently re-quire expensive equipment to maintain optimal conditions, an impractical option for low-scale studies. Currently popular ex-vivo methods lead to stunted embryonic limb development, a high infection and fatality rate. As an alternative, the presented paper uses a novel, cost-effective set up to study the developing chick embryo as a biological model in order to visualize Chondrogenesis alongwith formation of ossification centers and apoptotic events occurring in the limb bud of the developing embryo.This cup-in-cup model constructed using polystyrene cups is instrumental in observing the developing embryos and correlating them to Hamilton-Hamburger (HH) de-velopmental stages without exposing them to the outside environment and approaching a near perfect embryo survival rate. Anatomical events during skeleton development such as chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and apoptosis are studied using Alcian Blue, Alizarin Red and Nile Blue Sulphate staining protocols revealing successful formation and progression of ossification cen-ters and apoptotic regions in the limb bud. The chick embryo system is an excellent model that aids in understanding osteogenesis at both basic and clinical science level and enhance our knowledge about embryological devel-opment. The cup-in-cup system presented in this study proves to be a realis-tic addition to the subject of embryology and an ideal, sustainable experi-mental medium for low-scale research studies.",<Go to ISI>://CABI:20210326274,,2021,10.38150/sajeb.11(3).p260-265,Journal Article,,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

A. Jesuyon;A. A. Aganga;M. Orunmuyi;G. T. Falade,Animal Production Science,Animal Production Science,"ContextQuail production is increasingly emerging as a low-capital, cheap, alternative source for supplementing protein intake among peoples in tropical countries such as Nigeria.AimsTo increase animal protein sources, promote their availability to rural people, and reduce the unit cost of protein to the people, the effect of dietary crude protein on feed consumption, egg productivity and egg-quality characteristics of quail in the high-altitude Ekiti area of Nigeria was evaluated.MethodsIn total, 142 mature Japanese quails, divided into four groups with four replicates per group, were fed with four diets differing in dietary protein concentration with a near-isocaloric maize-groundnut cake-soybean meal-based diets for 10 weeks. Three experimental diets (18%, 22% and 24% crude protein (CP)) were tested and compared with a control 20% CP diet, in a completely randomised design of four replicates per treatment. Each consisted of 10 quails/cage at 5 weeks of age. Parameters measured on each quail included feed intake, egg number and egg-quality characteristics. Data were subjected to general linear model, regression and Duncan multiple-range procedures for means separation by SAS(R)v9.4 (2013).Key resultsIncreasing dietary protein from 18% to 24% in the diet of experimental quails decreased daily feed intake, hen-day egg production (HDP) and average egg mass (AEM; P < 0.05) during egg lay, whereas egg weight and diameter, egg shell weight, albumen weight, height and percentage, and yolk height increased significantly (P < 0.05). The 18% CP diet produced the highest HDP and AEM responses (P < 0.05). The 20% CP diet produced the highest numerical shell and yolk percentages (P > 0.05). Birds on 22% CP diet consumed the lowest quantity of feed (daily feed intake, P < 0.05) and had the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR, P > 0.05). Birds on 24% CP diet produced the highest egg weight and diameter, egg shell weight, albumen weight, height and percentage, and yolk height (P < 0.05). Haugh unit values were high and uninfluenced by an increasing dietary protein concentration (P > 0.05). The high and above-threshold environmental temperature-humidity index value of the test station resulted in heat stress during egg production, and was considered major cause of the generally low productivity and low egg-trait values obtained.ConclusionsThe 18% CP diet produced the highest HDP and AEM, while the 22% CP diet was the most efficiently utilised diet, and 24% CP diet stimulated higher egg-weight and egg-quality traits.ImplicationsMassive quail egg production could be sustained among rural people with the 18% CP diet, with adequate energy level, and without adverse effects on egg quality.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000651491300001,"Fed Univ, Anim Prod & Hlth Dept, Aare Afao Rd,PMB 373, Oye Ekiti 371104, Ekiti State, Nigeria",2022,10.1071/An20399,Journal Article,egg mass;egg-quality traits;feed consumption;haugh unit;humid forest environment;hen-day egg production;quail production;growth-performance;crude protein;feed-intake;energy;parameters;traits;stress;weight;yield,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

Savsani;M. Jain,Eur J Pharmacol,Eur J Pharmacol,"Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes, marked by retinal vascular damage, inflammation, and angiogenesis. This study's objective was to assess the potential benefits of saroglitazar, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha/gamma (PPAR-alpha/gamma) agonist in diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy was induced by streptozotocin in Sprague Dawley rats. The effect of saroglitazar was also assessed in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model in newborn rats and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Treatment of saroglitazar (1 and 4 mg/kg, oral) for 12 weeks significantly ameliorated retinal vascular leakage and leukostasis in the diabetic rats. Saroglitazar decreased oxidative stress, VEGF receptor signalling, NF-kappaBp65, and ICAM-1 in the retina of diabetic rats. The beneficial effects of saroglitazar (1 and 4 mg/kg, oral) were also observed on the neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy in newborn rats. Saroglitazar also reduced VEGF-induced angiogenesis in CAM assay.

K. Lee;M. J. Kim;S. H. Son;K. R. Kim;K. K. Park;W. Y. Chung,,,"Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and migration are critical steps in tumor angiogenesis. Here, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of xanthorrhizol, a sesquiterpenoid isolated from the Indonesian medicinal plant Curcuma xanthorrhiza. Xanthorrhizol at noncytotoxic concentrations inhibited the proliferation, migration, and formation of capillary-like tubes in VEGF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Xanthorrhizol inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin in VEGF-treated HUVECs. The expression and transcriptional activity of NF-[Formula: see text]B were downregulated by xanthorrhizol in VEGF-treated HUVECs. Furthermore, xanthorrhizol significantly inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane of fertilized eggs and Matrigel plugs subcutaneously injected into mice. Xanthorrhizol inhibited tumor volume and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice inoculated with breast cancer cells. The in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic activities of xanthorrhizol were as potent as those of curcumin, a well-known anticancer agent derived from C. longa. Taken together, xanthorrhizol inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis of endothelial cells by blocking the activation of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS axis and subsequent upregulation of adhesion molecules induced by the transcriptional activation of NF-[Formula: see text]B.

Iseki,Avian Dis,Avian Dis,"Sigma C protein-coding sequences have been used to phylogenetically classify avian reovirus (ARV) strains. However, the relationship between serotype and phylogenetic cluster classification of the five prototype serotype strains of ARV in Japan has not been established. Thus, we used sigma C protein-coding sequences to characterize avian reoviruses (ARVs) isolated from chickens with tendonitis in Japan together with the five prototype serotype strains of ARV in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of ARVs based on the sigma C protein-coding sequences revealed that the five prototype serotype strains of ARV were each classified into different, independent clusters. Two field isolates (JP/Tottori/2016 and JP/Nagasaki/2017) that were isolated from chickens with arthritis/tenosynovitis were classified into different clusters. JP/Tottori/2016 was classified into cluster VI with the CS-108 strain, and JP/Nagasaki/2017 was classified into cluster I with strain TS-142. Serologically, JP/Tottori/2016 was well-neutralized by antisera against the CS-108 strain, whereas JP/Nagasaki/2017 cross-reacted with antisera against both the CS-108 and TS-142 strains. Embryo lethality test revealed that the two field isolates induced 80% and 67% embryo mortality, respectively, whereas the five prototype strains induced 0%-33% embryo mortality.

Backyard poultry birds are more vulnerable to the pronounced effect of global warming due to their scavenging nature. This investigation was carried out to determine the effect of thermal manipulation (temperature 39.5˚C, d11-d16 of embryogenesis for 5h/day (ETM) vs standard incubational temperature 37.5˚(C) in CARI-Debendra backyard variety on zootechnical parameters, immune response and HSP 70 gene expression. Control embryos were incubated at temperature 37.5˚C and RH 60% in setter. There was no significant difference in hatchability of control (63.53%) and ETM (63.23%) group though the external pipping was 12h earlier in ETM group. The ETM chicks exhibited significantly (Pd”0.05) higher body temperature (97.81±0.28˚C vs 96.63±0.56˚C) than control chicks at hatching which waned into insignificance in adult life. First week and final body weight at 12 weeks of control and ETM group did not differ significantly. Significant difference was observed only in relative thigh weight, spleen weight at 6 weeks but not in cell-mediated immune response. Differential expression of HSP70 differs significantly in liver only between control and ETM group. This study improved the understanding of ETM with regards to thermotolerance in slow-growing dual-purpose CARI-Debendra variety preferred in tropical climate.

Methods: Different doses of MDCK-Va and chicken embryo-based quadrivalent influenza split vaccine (egg-Va) were intramuscularly immunized BALB/c mice twice with an interval of three weeks. Serum samples were collected to detect antibody titers using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. BALB/c mice were immunized with different doses of MDCK-Va combined with QS21, AddVax, PolyI:C, CpG ODN 1826 and AddVax/PolyI:C (Add/Poly), respectively. HI and microneutralization assays were used to detect antibody titers 21 d after the first and booster immunization. Spleen tissues were collected from the mice immunized with 10 μg MDCK-Va combined with the above adjuvants 5 d after the booster immunization to analyze spleen index and the types of spleen cells. Results: The immunoprotective effect of MDCK-Va was not inferior to that of egg-Va. MDCK-Va combined with each of the above adjuvants could induce higher HI antibody titer than MDCK-Va alone, especially the QS21/Va and Add/Poly/Va groups, and the differences were statistically significant. For H1N1 vaccine, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between HI antibody and neutralizing antibody was 0.737-0.910, and for H3N2 subtype vaccine, the value of r was 0.839-0.947. Compared with the MDCK-Va group, the QS21/Va group showed significantly increased spleen index and decreased proportion of single lymphocytes. QS21 and Add/Poly were much better than other adjuvants in stimulating mouse splenic neutrophils and CD4/CD8 cells. Conclusions: Add/Poly had a stronger immune enhancement effect on MDCK-Va, suggesting that it was a potential adjuvant for MDCK-Va.

To protect chickens from MDV infection, an avirulent live vaccine of turkey herpesvirus (HVT) has been successfully used in chickens worldwide. Many vaccine manufacturers have used chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells to produce the HVT vaccine. Generally, it has been suggested that HVT is a highly cell-associated herpesvirus that spread via cell-to-cell contact, but it is unclear how HVT is transmitted from infected cells to uninfected target cells. Here, we show via immunofluorescence analysis that nanotubes containing the actin cytoskeleton and HVT antigens from infected CEF cells were observed to contact neighboring cells. When the infected cells were treated with inhibitors for actin polymerization or depolymerization, the formation and extension of the nanotubes from infected cells were greatly inhibited and the intercellular contact was abolished, leading to a drastic reduction in plaque formation and viral titers of the cell-associated virus. Our data indicate that cell-to-cell contacts via nanotubes composed of actin filaments are essential for efficient viral spreading and replication.

Li,Acta Veterinaria et Zootechnica Sinica,Acta Veterinaria et Zootechnica Sinica,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether mitochondrial calcium uniporter(MCU) mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ transport was involved in hypoxia-induced mitochondrial damage in broiler cardiomyocytes. In this experiment, the primary cardiomyocytes of chicken embryos of white feathered broilers were isolated and cultured for 24, 48 and 72 h under hypoxic conditions (3%O2, 5%CO2, 92%N2). In order to further determine the role of MCU in mitochondrial injury induced by hypoxia, RU360 was pretreated in the hypoxia group for 72 h to inhibit the expression of MCU. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration, mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species level and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Gene and protein expressions of MCU and its regulatory factors were detected. The results showed that the purity of cardiomyocytes cultured by differential velocity adherent method could reach over 90%. After 24 h of hypoxic culture, the expression of MCU and MICU1 genes were increased (P<0.05), the concentrations of Ca2+ in cytoplasm and mitochondria were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the mitochondrial membrane potential was increased (P<0.05). The expression levels of MCUR1 and MICU1 mRNA were decreased (P<0.05) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased (P<0.05) after 48 h hypoxia culture. After 72 h of hypoxic culture, MCU mRNA expression, intracellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ were increased (P<0.01), and reactive oxygen species were increased (P<0.01), while mitochondial membrane potential decreased (P<0.01). Compared with the 72 h hypoxic group, the Ca2+ in cells and mitochondria decreased, the mitochondrial membrane potential increased and the reactive oxygen species decreased in the RU360 preconditioning group (P<0.01), the expression of MCU mRNA was decreased (P<0.01). The results showed that hypoxia-induced MCU upregulation leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte injury. Inhibition of MCU expression can reduce hypoxia-induced mitochondrial calcium overload and protect mitochondrial function.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2016104326&from=export,"Y.

Lopatina,,,"Sympathetic and sensory nerve fibers regulate osteosynthesis and osteoresorption processes throughout life. Fundamental research and clinical data confirm the existence of functional interactions between neurons and bone tissue cells and indicate the catabolic and anabolic effect of sympathetic nervous system mediators on bone tissue. There is practically no information about the regulation of osteoremodeling in embryogenesis. Objective: to study the effect of norepinephrine on the growth of bone tissue explants in the embryonic period of development. The studies were performed on the bone tissue explants of 12-day old chicken embryos. Norepinephrine (10–10 M — 10–4 M), propranolol (10–10 M), atenolol (10–4 M), urapidil (10–6 M) were added to the experimental Petri dishes. Norepinephrine (10–6 M) stimulates the growth of the bone tissue explants through α1-adrenoreceptors. The osteotoxic effect of high doses of the drug is realized through β2-adrenoreceptors. Embryonic osteogenesis is regulated by norepinephrine in dose-dependent manner.

Kalyani;Namita Desai,Drug Delivery Letters,Drug Delivery Letters,"Background: Acyclovir, BCS Class III drug is commercially available as 3% w/w eye ointment for multiple applications. Acyclovir nanoemulsions can be proposed to reduce dose be-cause of improved permeation characteristics. Further, the development of in situ ophthalmic gels can be advantageous to reduce the number of applications due to increased mucoadhesion and sus-taining effect. Objective: The purpose of this study was the development and evaluation of nanoemulsions based in situ gels of Acyclovir (1% w/w) as potential ophthalmic delivery systems. Methods: Nanoemulsions of Acyclovir were developed by Phase Inversion Temperature method using Capmul MCM, stearyl amine and Kolliphor RH 40 as liquid lipid, charge inducer and surfac-tant, respectively selected on the basis of Acyclovir solubility in the oil phase and emulsification ability of surfactants. These nanoemulsions were further developed into in situ ophthalmic gels using gellan gum and Methocel K4M. Results: The developed gels showed a sustained effect in vitro release studies and improved goat corneal permeation in ex vivo studies when compared to marketed ointment. HET-CAM studies concluded the absence of irritation potential, while in vivo irritation study in Wistar rats showed the absence of erythema and swelling of eyes after visual inspection for 72 hours. Histopathological studies on isolated rat corneas showed no abnormalities in anterior corneal epithelium and corneal stroma without any epithelial hyperplasia. Acyclovir nanoemulsions based in situ ophthalmic gel showed increased corneal deposition and permeation in isolated rat eyes.

Selestin Raja;A. Dhanasekaran;S. Vimalraj;S. Rajalakshmi,Eur J Pharm Sci,Eur J Pharm Sci,"Bone tissue regeneration is augmented by biocompatible nanofiber scaffolds, that supports reliable and enhanced bone formation. Zinc is an essential mineral that is vital for routine skeletal growth and it emerges to be able to improve bone regeneration. Phytochemicals, particularly flavonoids have achieved prominent interest for their therapeutic ability, they have demonstrated promising effects on bone by encouraging osteoblastogenesis, which finally leads to bone formation. In this study, we have synthesized bioactive zinc(II) quercetin complex material and used for nanofibers scaffold fabrication to enhance bone tissue regeneration property. Two derivatives of zinc(II) quercetin complexes [(Zn(quercetin) (H(2)O)(2)) (Zn+Q), and Zn(quercetin)(phenanthroline) (Zn+Q(PHt)) have been synthesized and characterized using UV-Visible spectrophotometer and Fourier Transform-IR spectroscopy. The UV-Visible absorption and IR spectra prove the B-ring chelation of the flavonoid quercetin to zinc(II) rather C-ring chelation. The potential ability of the above synthesized metal complexes on osteogenesis and angiogenesis have been studied. Besides the bioactivity of the metal complexes, the control quercetin has also been examined. The chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay demonstrated that the angiogenic parameters were increased by the (Zn+Q(PHt)) complex. Amongst, (Zn+Q(PHt)) complex showed significant activity and thereby this complex has been further examined for the bone tissue activity by incorporating the complex into a nanofiber through electrospinning method. At the molecular level, Runx2, mRNA and protein, ALP and type 1 collagen mRNAs, and osteoblast-specific microRNA, pre-mir-15b were examined using real time RT-PCR and Western blot assay. Histology studies showed that the (PCL/gelatin/Zn+Q(PHt)) was biocompatibility in-ovo. Overall, the present study showed that quercetin-zinc complex (Zn+Q(PHt)) incorporated into PCL/gelatin nanofiber can act as a pharmacological agent for treating bone associated defects and promote bone regeneration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607242,"Chemical Biology and Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, AU-KBC Research Centre, Anna University, MIT, Campus, Chrompet, Chennai 600 044, India.Centre for Nanotechnology & Advance Biomaterials (CeNTAB), Department of Bioengineering, School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur 613 401, Tamil Nadu, India.Centre for Environmental Studies, Anna University, Guindy, Chennai 600 025, India.BIO-IT Foundry Technology Institute, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University, Guindy, Chennai 600 025, India.Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University, Guindy, Chennai 600 025, India; Department of Pharmacology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS), Chennai 600 077, Tamil Nadu, India.

J. Shai;M. L. Mphaphathi,Reproduction Fertility and Development,Reprod Fert Develop,"In poultry industry, chick viability is a crucial factor determining profitability from fertilized egg to placement at the farm. However, decreases in fertility and hatchability have been observed. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) due to their antimicrobial properties and growth-promoting ability, and diamond nanoparticles (D-NPs) due to their biocompatibility properties. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of silver and diamond nanoparticles on chicken embryo oxidative status, biochemical indices, and expression of immune-related genes and on sperm cell viability. The experiment was conducted in Ross 308 chicken embryos and Ross 308 cockerels. One hundred and fifty fertilized eggs were divided randomly into 5 groups (5×30). Fertilized eggs were injected with 50 mg/L Ag-NPs at volumes of 100μL (group 1), 200μL (group 2) or 50 mg/L D-NPs at volumes of 100μL (group 3) or 200μL (group 4), or received no nanoparticles (control; group 5) and incubated at 37°C and 55% humidity for 20 days. Then, chicken blood was collected and centrifuged to evaluate alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, urea, and free haemoglobin. Chicken embryo liver was used to evaluate antioxidant capacity (TAC) and chicken embryo spleen was used to evaluate expression of the immune-related genes interleukin-1β (IL-1β), toll-like receptor (TLR)4, TLR2, and TLR15. Semen was randomly divided into 1 control and 8 treatment groups and treated with 50 mg/L Ag-NPs: group A (0.1ppm), group B (1ppm), group C (5ppm), group D (10ppm) or 50 mg/L D-NPs: group E (1ppm), group F (5ppm), group G (10ppm), and group H (20ppm). Sperm viability was analysed using prestoblue metabolic assay. Data were analysed using PROC in GLM procedure of SAS 2014 (SAS Institute Inc.). Decrease in sperm cell viability was recorded in a dose-dependent manner. Sperm cell viability decreased (P<0.005) as the concentration of Ag-NP or D-NP increased. Addition of 100μL of Ag-NPs increased the growth rate of chicken embryo but not 200μL of Ag-NPs or addition of D-NPs. Increases in ALP, ALT, LDH, glucose and urea enzyme were observed in a dose-dependent manner in both Ag-NPs and D-NPs. Addition of 50 mg/L Ag-NPs or 50 mg/L D-NPs increased (P<0.001) TAC of chicken embryo as the volume increased. Additions of 200μL of Ag-NPs, 100μL of D-NPs, and 200μL of D-NPs were haemolytic (P<0.001) but addition of 100μL of Ag-NPs was not. Additions of 100 or 200μL of Ag-NPs or 100μL of D-NPs downregulated IL-1β and 200μL of D-NPs upregulated IL-1β compared with the untreated control group. Additions of 100 or 200μL of Ag-NPs or 200μL of D-NPs induced expression of TLR4 and TLR15. Furthermore, addition of Ag-NPs did not result in expression of TLR2. We concluded that administration of 50 mg/L Ag-NPs and 50 mg/L D-NPs in ovo improve immune status and administration of 100μL of Ag-NPs improved the growth rate of chicken embryo. However, toxicity associated with 50 mg/L Ag-NPs and 50 mg/L D-NPs remains a concern and need to be addressed before use.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000683702900009,"Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Anim Sci, Pretoria, South AfricaAgr Res Council, Germplasm Conservat & Reprod Biotechnol, Pretoria, South Africa",2021,10.1071/RDv33n2Ab44,Journal Article,,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

Castro;A. G. Sikora;S. P. Lerner,Cancer Research,Cancer Res,"Introduction: Non-metastatic muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer (MIBC) has a poor prognosis and standard of care (SOC) consists of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (NAC) combined with cystectomy. Patients receiving SOC have at best <10% improvement in five-year overall survival. Residual invasive cancer following NAC has no SOC and has high mortality risk. This major clinical problem underscores gaps in our understanding resistance mechanisms and a need for reliable pre-clinical models. The chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) represents a rapid, scalable, and cost-effective alternative in vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) platform. It leverages an easily accessible engraftment scaffold and vascular-rich, immunosuppressed environments for the engraftment of PDX tumors and subsequent functional studies. Our previous proteogenomic data on MIBCs with known chemo-resistant outcomes obtained prior to NAC (pre-NAC) suggests a benefit from treatment with kinase inhibitors (KI). Use of the CAM model in this study aims to address the MIBC pre-clinical model deficit and allow for the rapid screening of therapeutics against NAC-resistant PDXs using selected KI. Methods: We employed the CAM model to expand primary MIBC tumors and tested concordance between cisplatin-based chemotherapy response of patients to matching PDX tumors. We also tested selected KI response on chemotherapy-resistant bladder cancers. PDX growth was assessed by tumor surface area quantification following a week of growth with chemotherapy and KI treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining coupled with in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry for Ki67, and cleaved PARP helped identify tumor cells on the CAM as well as their proliferative and apoptotic indexes. Results: Our initial results show pre-NAC primary MIBC tumors grown on the CAM phenocopy cisplatin-based chemotherapy resistance observed in parent tumor specimens. Histological analysis confirmed engraftment and growth of bladder tumors on the CAM. Patient tumor specimens acquired after chemotherapy treatment (post-NAC) and exhibiting NAC resistance were engrafted successfully on the CAM. Such CAM PDX tumors displayed decreased tumor growth size and proliferation in response to treatment with a dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitor, but had no significant response to either CDK4/6 or FGFR inhibition. Conclusion: Our data suggests concordance between Cisplatin-based chemotherapy resistance phenotypes in primary patient tumors and CAM PDX models. Further, proteogenomic informed KI use on MIBC CAM PDX models suggests a benefit from integration of rapid in vivo testing of novel therapeutics to inform more complex, pre-clinical mouse PDX experiments for more effective clinical trial design aimed at achieving optimal precision medicine for patients with limited treatment options.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000680263506337,"Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USAMD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX USA",2021,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2021-2998,Journal Article,,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

Zeng,Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics,Prog Biochem Biophys,"Full-field label-free optical angiography is a powerful imaging technique that aids study of cardiovascular diseases in live animal models. Here, we presented a novel method that combined absorption intensity fluctuation modulation imaging with sub-pixel matching based on a normalized cross-correlation algorithm to eliminate blurring of angiograms caused by system drift or biological jitter. Raw images showing absorption difference between red blood cells and background tissue under illumination with low-coherence light were captured and divided into several short image sequences. These sequences were then used for image reconstruction using absorption intensity fluctuation modulation imaging to achieve full-field angiography by isolating dynamic red blood cell signals from the background signal in the frequency domain. All the reconstructed images were then matched with the first reconstructed image using the normalized cross-correlation algorithm and subsequently fused. In vivo angiography near chicken embryo heart was performed to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and it produced clear, blur-free angiograms with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000757110800015,"Foshan Univ, Sch Phys & Optoelect Engn, Foshan 528225, Peoples R ChinaFoshan Univ, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Intelligent M, Foshan 528225, Peoples R China",2021,10.16476/j.pibb.2021.0012,Journal Article,absorption imaging;normalized cross-correlation;image matching;image analysis;blood-flow-velocity,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

The occurrence, location, distribution and quantity change of IgA+ secreting cells were studied by immunohistochemical method.Result There was no IgA+ cell in the mucosa of each respiratory organ during the embryonic period. IgA+ cells were present in the nose and lung at 1-day-old age, laryngeal mucosa at 4-day-old age, and tracheal mucosa at 7-day-old age. The number of IgA+ cells in the respiratory mucosa of each organ increased gradually with the increase of age. The lymphoid aggregates were formed earlier in the nasal mucosa and the intersections of the primary and secondary bronchus in the lung at 4-day-old age, and formed in the laryngeal mucosa at 7-day-old age, in the tracheal mucosa at 35-day-old age. The IgA+ cells in these lymphoid aggregates were all mainly distributed on the periphery of the lymphoid aggregates. At 35-day-old age, there were more IgA+ cells in the mucosal lamina propria and the epithelium of the nose, larynx and trachea, and thus more effective and direct secretion of SIgA could be performed for mucosal immunity. At 56-day-old age, the number of IgA+ cells in the respiratory mucosa of the four organs reached a peak and germinal centers were formed at the mucosal bottom, which was the characteristic of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue, thus more effectively performed mucosal immune function.Conclusion The distribution and number of IgA+ cells in the respiratory mucosa of chickens show age-related changes, and the number and distribution of IgA+ cells in the nose, larynx, trachea and lung all reach a certain scale at 35-day-old, which can provide immune protection for the respiratory mucosa.",<Go to ISI>://CABI:20220431636,,2021,10.7671/j.issn.1001-411X.202101047,Journal Article,,,2023-08-07 14:40:51,e98127ba-c265-4b5c-8d9d-702ce973b094,upload test,

Results: In terms of humoral immunity, the serum titer of the cellular vaccine group was basically the same as that of the chicken embryo vaccine group. As to cellular immunity, the secretion level of immune-related cytokines in the cellular vaccine group was more significant. Conclusion: Due to the different culture media, the two monovalent influenza vaccines have certain differences in the induction of immune response. Cellular vaccine has the advantage of inducing multiple immune responses, and the combination of other advantages of cellular technology indicates that the use of cellular technology will become a trend to produce influenza vaccine.

Gerst;Alyssa Rosemartin;Theresa M. Crimmins;Jeffrey C. Oliver,Insects,,"Agriculture has long been a part of the urban landscape, from gardens to small scale farms. In recent decades, interest in producing food in cities has grown dramatically, with an estimated 30% of the global urban population engaged in some form of food production. Identifying and managing the insect biodiversity found on city farms is a complex task often requiring years of study and specialization, especially in urban landscapes which have a complicated tapestry of fragmentation, diversity, pollution, and introduced species. Supporting urban growers with relevant data informs insect management decision-making for both growers and their neighbors, yet this information can be difficult to come by. In this study, we introduced several web-based citizen science programs that can connect growers with useful data products and people to help with the who, what, where, and when of urban insects. Combining the power of citizen science volunteers with the efforts of urban farmers can result in a clearer picture of the diversity and ecosystem services in play, limited insecticide use, and enhanced non-chemical alternatives. Connecting urban farming practices with citizen science programs also demonstrates the ecosystem value of urban agriculture and engages more citizens with the topics of food production, security, and justice in their communities.",https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/10/9/294,,2019,10.3390/insects10090294,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,XIES4A2R

Schneider;Jose Luis Fernandez-Marquez;Julien Da Costa;Brian Fuchs;Laure Kloetzer,Human Computation,,"Citizen Cyberscience (CCS) projects are online projects that engage participants with no necessary prior scientific experience in online tasks of very varied types and that contribute to the scientific research in different domains. Many research studies confirm the usefulness of CCS projects to researchers while less has been done to explore their added-value for the participants. Specifically, we are interested to know to what extent CCS projects help participants learn while participating through typically small-sized and very specific tasks.We propose in this work to include another source of quantitative data to the research toolbox usually used to evaluate learning in informal learning contexts as the context of citizen science. This data source is learning analytics that makes use of the already very ubiquitous web analytics and that is heavily used in varied online learning environments. Based on our experience with two CCS pilot projects, we created a framework to help CCS project designers properly implement learning analytics in their project in order to make the full use of these analytics and integrate them with other sources of quantitative data related to the user experience. We apply the proposed framework to explore the interaction between learning and engagement in two pilot CCS projects of different types: volunteer thinking and gaming.

In contrast to the requirements associated with the Interoperability principle, the requirements associated with the Accessibility principle are often assumed to be relatively straightforward to implement. Indeed, a variety of different tools assessing FAIR rely on the data being deposited in a trustworthy digital repository. In this paper we note that there is an implicit assumption that access to a repository is independent of where the user is geographically located. Using a virtual personal network (VPN) service we find that access to a set of web sites that underpin Open Science is variable from a set of 14 countries; either through connectivity issues (i.e., connections to download HTML being dropped) or through direct blocking (i.e., web servers sending 403 error codes). Many of the countries included in this study are already marginalized from Open Science discussions due to political issues or infrastructural challenges. This study clearly indicates that access to FAIR data resources is influenced by a range of geo-political factors. Given the volatile nature of politics and the slow pace of infrastructural investment, this is likely to continue to be an issue and indeed may grow. We propose that it is essential for discussions and implementations of FAIR to include awareness of these issues of accessibility. Without this awareness, the expansion of FAIR data may unintentionally reinforce current access inequities and research inequalities around the globe.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2022.912456/full,,2022,10.3389/frma.2022.912456,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,R8QWGBXU

The Case of Open Data Practices in Educational Technology Research,Juliana Raffaghelli;Stefania Manca,Publications,,"In the landscape of Open Science, Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role as data are one of the most basic components of research, despite their diverse formats across scientific disciplines. Opening up data is a recent concern for policy makers and researchers, as the basis for good Open Science practices. The common factor underlying these new practices—the relevance of promoting Open Data circulation and reuse—is mostly a social form of knowledge sharing and construction. However, while data sharing is being strongly promoted by policy making and is becoming a frequent practice in some disciplinary fields, Open Data sharing is much less developed in Social Sciences and in educational research. In this study, practices of OD publication and sharing in the field of Educational Technology are explored. The aim is to investigate Open Data sharing in a selection of Open Data repositories, as well as in the academic social network site ResearchGate. The 23 Open Datasets selected across five OD platforms were analysed in terms of (a) the metrics offered by the platforms and the affordances for social activity; (b) the type of OD published; (c) the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) data principles compliance; and (d) the extent of presence and related social activity on ResearchGate. The results show a very low social activity in the platforms and very few correspondences in ResearchGate that highlight a limited social life surrounding Open Datasets.

We did this by comparing (i) the share of open and non-open access documents in different Climate Action topics, and their news counts, and (ii) the mean of news counts for open access and non-open access documents. The data set of this study comprised 70,206 articles and reviews in Sustainable Development Goal 13, published during 2014–2018, retrieved from SciVal. The number of news mentions for each document was obtained from Altmetrics Details Page API using their DOIs, whereas the open access statuses were obtained using Unpaywall.org. The analysis in this paper was done using a combination of (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic modelling, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis. The covariates included in the regression analysis were features related to authors, country, journal, institution, funding, readability, news source category and topic. Using topic modelling, we identified 10 topics, with topics 4 (meteorology) [21%], 5 (adaption, mitigation, and legislation) [18%] and 8 (ecosystems and biodiversity) [14%] accounting for 53% of the research in Sustainable Development Goal 13. Additionally, the results of regression analysis showed that while keeping all the variables constant in the model, open access papers in Climate Action had a news count advantage (8.8%) in comparison to non-open access papers. Our findings also showed that while a higher share of open access documents in topics such as topic 9 (Human vulnerability to risks) might not assist with its broader dissemination, in some others such as topic 5 (adaption, mitigation, and legislation), even a lower share of open access documents might accelerate its broad communication via news outlets.",https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11192-021-04095-7,,2021,10.1007/s11192-021-04095-7,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,PJYJVHZS

Schultz;Jeremy Walton,Geoscience Communication,,"Abstract. The need for open science has been recognized by the communities of meteorology and climate science. While these domains are mature in terms of applying digital technologies, the implementation of open science methodologies is less advanced. In a session on “Weather and Climate Science in the Digital Era” at the 14th IEEE International eScience Conference domain specialists and data and computer scientists discussed the road towards open weather and climate science. Roughly 80 % of the studies presented in the conference session showed the added value of open data and software. These studies included open datasets from disparate sources in their analyses or developed tools and approaches that were made openly available to the research community. Furthermore, shared software is a prerequisite for the studies which presented systems like a model coupling framework or digital collaboration platform. Although these studies showed that sharing code and data is important, the consensus among the participants was that this is not sufficient to achieve open weather and climate science and that there are important issues to address. At the level of technology, the application of the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles to many datasets used in weather and climate science remains a challenge. This may be due to scalability (in the case of high-resolution climate model data, for example), legal barriers such as those encountered in using weather forecast data, or issues with heterogeneity (for example, when trying to make use of citizen data). In addition, the complexity of current software platforms often limits collaboration between researchers and the optimal use of open science tools and methods. The main challenges we observed, however, were non-technical and impact the practice of science as a whole. There is a need for new roles and responsibilities in the scientific process. People working at the interface of science and digital technology – e.g., data stewards and research software engineers – should collaborate with domain researchers to ensure the optimal use of open science tools and methods. In order to remove legal boundaries on sharing data, non-academic parties such as meteorological institutes should be allowed to act as trusted agents. Besides the creation of these new roles, novel policies regarding open weather and climate science should be developed in an inclusive way in order to engage all stakeholders. Although there is an ongoing debate on open science in the community, the individual aspects are usually discussed in isolation. Our approach in this paper takes the discourse further by focusing on “open science in weather and climate research” as a whole. We consider all aspects of open science and discuss the challenges and opportunities of recent open science developments in data, software, and hardware. We have compiled these into a list of concrete recommendations that could bring us closer to open weather and climate science. We acknowledge that the development of open weather and climate science requires effort to change, but the benefits are large. We have observed these benefits directly in the studies presented in the conference and believe that it leads to much faster progress in understanding our complex world.",https://gc.copernicus.org/articles/3/191/2020/,,2020,10.5194/gc-3-191-2020,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,VHHJDZE4

Sarmiento,BMC Public Health,,"Abstract                            Background               Santa Ana is home to an Afro-descendant rural population of the island of Barú in Cartagena, Colombia. While a popular area for tourism, Santa Ana’s population is affected by multidimensional poverty, precarious work conditions, homelessness, broken streets and sewer systems, limited quality education, and a lack of recreation and sport spaces. While Santa Ana’s Community Action Board aims to unify efforts and resources to solve these problems, the state’s capacity to meet the requirements of the Board is limited.                                         Methods                                We evaluated the relationship between healthy lifestyles and characteristics of Santa Ana’s school using the                 Our Voice                 Citizen Science Research Method. This systemic approach combines information and communication technologies with group facilitation to empower adolescents to: 1) collect and discuss data about factors in their local environments that facilitate or hinder well-being within their school community; 2) identify relevant local stakeholders who could help to address the issues identified; and 3) advocate collectively for local improvements to support increased well-being at a community level.                                                        Results                                Eleven citizen scientists ages 13 to 17 years from the science club of Institución Educativa Santa Ana were recruited and together conducted 11 walks within the school to collect data about the facilitators and barriers to student well-being. They identified barriers to well-being related to school infrastructure, furniture, bathrooms, and sense of belonging. They then advocated with school stakeholders and reached agreements on concrete actions to address identified barriers, including fostering a culture among students of caring for school property and presenting their findings to the community action board. This methodology allowed the community to realize how students can become agents of change and take collective action when motivated by solution-oriented methodologies such as                 Our Voice.                 Project ripple effects, including greater empowerment and participation in collective actions by students, also were observed.                                                        Conclusions                                This study underscores the importance of the school’s built environment in the well-being of students in rural areas. The                 Our Voice                 method provided the opportunity to inform school-based interventions, and promoted ripple effects that expanded productive dialogue to the community level and generated systemic actions involving actors outside of the school community.",https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14559-x,,2022,10.1186/s12889-022-14559-x,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,KMHYPYDZ

In the context of electronic journals, both open access and restricted access options exist. While the latter option is comparable to traditional, subscription-based paper journals, open access journal publications follow an “open science” publishing model allowing scholarly communications and outputs to be publicly available online at no cost to the reader. However, for readers to enjoy open access, publication costs are shifted elsewhere, typically onto academic institutions and authors. SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the benefits of open science through accelerated research and unprecedented levels of collaboration and data sharing. South Africa is one of the leading open access countries on the African continent. This paper focuses on open access in the South African higher education research context with an emphasis on our Institution and our own experiences. It also addresses the financial implications of open access and provides possible solutions for reducing the cost of publication for researchers and their institutions. Privacy in open access and the role of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) in medical research and secondary use of data in South Africa will also be discussed.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2022.975109/full,,2022,10.3389/frma.2022.975109,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,HELFX3JQ

Open science increases trust in science for the public and academics,Hyunjin Song;David M Markowitz;Samuel Hardman Taylor,Journal of Communication,,"Abstract             Researchers often focus on the benefits of adopting open science, yet questions remain whether the general public, as well as academics, value and trust studies consistent with open science compared to studies without open science. In three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,691), we find that the general public perceived open science research and researchers as more credible and trustworthy than non-open science counterparts (Studies 1 and 2). We also explored if open science practices compensated for negative perceptions of privately-funded research versus publicly-funded research (Study 2), although the evidence did not support this hypothesis. Finally, Study 3 examined how communication scholars perceive researchers and their work as a function of open science adoption, along with publication outlet (e.g., high-prestige vs. low-prestige journals). We observed open science research was perceived more favorably than non-open science research by academics. We discuss implications for the open science movement and public trust in science.",https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/72/4/497/6623479,,2022,10.1093/joc/jqac017,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,4GZGF6WV

Marijn Poortvliet;Arnold J. H. Van Vliet;Constantianus J. M. Koenraadt;Chantal M. Ingabire;Leon Mutesa;Cees Leeuwis,Malaria Journal,,"Abstract                            Background               Malaria control remains a challenge globally and in malaria-endemic countries in particular. In Rwanda, a citizen science programme has been set up to improve malaria control. Citizens are involved in collecting mosquito species and reporting mosquito nuisance. This study assessed what people benefit from such a citizen science programme. The analysis was conducted on how the citizen science programme influenced perceptions and behaviour related to malaria control.                                         Methods               This study employed a mixed-methods approach using dissemination workshops, a survey, and village meetings as the main data collection methods. Dissemination workshops and village meetings involved 112 volunteers of the citizen science programme and were conducted to explore: (1) the benefits of being involved in the programme and (2) different ways used to share malaria-related information to non-volunteers. The survey involved 328 people (110 volunteers and 218 non-volunteers) and was used to compare differences in malaria-related perceptions and behaviour over time (between 2017 and 2019), as well as between volunteers and non-volunteers.                                         Results               Malaria-related perceptions and behaviour changed significantly over time (between 2017 and 2019) and became favourable to malaria control. When the findings were compared between volunteers and non-volunteers, for perceptions, only perceived self-efficacy showed a significant difference between these two groups. However, volunteers showed significantly more social interaction, participation in malaria-related activities at the community level, and indoor residual spraying (IRS) acceptance. In addition, both volunteers and non-volunteers reported to have gained knowledge and skills about the use of malaria control measures in general, and mosquito species in particular among volunteers.                                         Conclusion               The reported knowledge and skills gained among non-volunteers indicate a diffusion of the citizen science programme-related information in the community. Thus, the citizen science programme has the potential to provide individual and collective benefits to volunteers and society at large.",https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-020-03349-8,,2020,10.1186/s12936-020-03349-8,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,7C3RUWXD

Karopka;H. Schmuhl;A. Marcelo;J. Dal Molin;G. Wright,Yearbook of Medical Informatics,,"Summary             To analyze the contribution of Free/Libre Open Source Software in health care (FLOSS-HC) and to give perspectives for future developments.             The paper summarizes FLOSS-related trends in health care as anticipated by members of the IMIA Open Source Working Group. Data were obtained through literature review and personal experience and observations of the authors in the last two decades. A status quo is given by a frequency analysis of the database of Medfloss.org, one of the world’s largest platforms dedicated to FLOSS-HC. The authors discuss current problems in the field of health care and finally give a prospective roadmap, a projection of the potential influences of FLOSS in health care.             FLOSS-HC already exists for more than 2 decades. Several projects have shown that FLOSS may produce highly competitive alternatives to proprietary solutions that are at least equivalent in usability and have a better total cost of ownership ratio. The Medfloss.org database currently lists 221 projects of diverse application types.             FLOSS principles hold a great potential for addressing several of the most critical problems in health care IT. The authors argue that an ecosystem perspective is relevant and that FLOSS principles are best suited to create health IT systems that are able to evolve over time as medical knowledge, technologies, insights, workflows etc. continuously change. All these factors that inherently influence the development of health IT systems are changing at an ever growing pace. Traditional models of software engineering are not able to follow these changes and provide up-to-date systems for an acceptable cost/value ratio. To allow FLOSS to positively influence Health IT in the future a ""FLOSS-friendly"" environment has to be provided. Policy makers should resolve uncertainties in the legal framework that disfavor FLOSS. Certification procedures should be specified in a way that they do not raise additional barriers for FLOSS.",http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0038-1638740,,2011,10.1055/s-0038-1638740,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,A7G4F79B

Agriculture and agricultural supply chains are increasingly reliant on data, including its access and provision from the farm to the consumer. Far-reaching data provision inevitably needs the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) that offer data originators and depository custodians with a set of guidelines to safeguard a progressive data availability and reusability. Through a systematic literature review it is apparent that although FAIR data principles can play a key role in achieving sustainable agricultural operational and business performance, there are few published studies on how they have been adopted and used. The investigation examines: (1) how FAIR data assimilate with the sustainability framework; and (2) whether the use of FAIR data by the agriculture industry, has an impact on agricultural performance. The work identifies a social science research gap and suggests a method to guide agriculture practitioners in identifying the specific barriers in making their data FAIR. By troubleshooting the barriers, the value propositions of adopting FAIR data in agriculture can be better understood and addressed.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/2/309,,2022,10.3390/agriculture12020309,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,AFFDBDAZ

Lapworth;Rosalind Malcolm;Katherine Pond,Resources,,"To achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking-water quality and sanitation for all, and 10, to reduce inequality within and among countries, additional and urgent work is required. Efforts to achieve these Goals in the context of small drinking-water supplies, which are the furthest behind in regards to progress, are of particular need. Reasons for this disparity in progress include the remoteness of access to small drinking-water supplies and the lack of technical and financial capacity for monitoring supplies. The World Health Organization promote the use of Sanitary inspection (SI) as an on-site assessment of risk. Despite the potential to increase the body of knowledge and information on supplies in a region, there has been limited research into the role of citizen science and SIs. To meet SDG targets, we need to improve the reach of SIs. This study uses a mixed methods approach of quantitative on-site SI data collection and remote SI data collection via photographic images, together with qualitative data collection, collected by non-expert students, who are citizens of Malawi, as well as a panel of experts in the field of SI. Results indicate that, although further research into the topic is required prior to widescale implementation, the potential exists for citizens to conduct SI, with remote expert verification of the results using photographic images of supplies. Further documentation or guidance is required to support citizens in this process. The results highlight a critical gap in the availability of appropriate documentation for unprotected spring sources which is urgently required. The use of citizen science for SI data collection is in its infancy. However, this study indicates that there is potential to explore the use of citizen science in this area, which will contribute to achieving SDGs 6 and 10.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/9/12/142,,2020,10.3390/resources9120142,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,MF2QASW7

The methodological innovation draws from engaged ethnography to enable Delhi’s water-poor to sample their own water. In doing so, community members become active partners who can better direct scientific inquiry. Their participation as active partners further empowers them as water stakeholders.

To unleash this impact, a clearer understanding of its current status and challenges for its development is needed. Using quantitative indicators developed in a collaborative stakeholder process, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of CS in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our online survey with 340 responses focused on CS impact through (1) scientific practices, (2) participant learning and empowerment, and (3) socio-political processes. With regard to scientific impact, we found that data quality control is an established component of CS practice, while publication of CS data and results has not yet been achieved by all project coordinators (55%). Key benefits for citizen scientists were the experience of collective impact (“making a difference together with others”) as well as gaining new knowledge. For the citizen scientists’ learning outcomes, different forms of social learning, such as systematic feedback or personal mentoring, were essential. While the majority of respondents attributed an important value to CS for decision-making, only few were confident that CS data were indeed utilized as evidence by decision-makers. Based on these results, we recommend (1) that project coordinators and researchers strengthen scientific impact by fostering data management and publications, (2) that project coordinators and citizen scientists enhance participant impact by promoting social learning opportunities and (3) that project initiators and CS networks foster socio-political impact through early engagement with decision-makers and alignment with ongoing policy processes.

The project investigates the distribution of heavy metals in air pollution using moss growing on street trees as a bio-indicator in two industrial-adjacent neighborhoods in Seattle, Washington (USA). One goal of the ongoing project is to meaningfully engage local urban youths (eighth to twelfth grade) in the scientific process as civic scientists, and teach them about environmental health, environmental justice, and urban forestry concepts in a place-based, urban-oriented environmental research project. We describe the collaborative context in which our project developed, evaluate the quality of youth-collected data through analysis of replicate samples, and assess participants’ learning, career interests, and overall appraisal of the pilot. Our results indicate that youth scientists collected usable samples (with acceptable precision among repeated samples), learned project content (with statistically significant increases in scores of test-style survey questions; p = 0.002), and appraised their engagement favorably (with 69% of participants reporting they liked the project). We observed few changes in career interests, however.

However, recent progress in open and citizen science may be the key to strengthening the relationship between researchers and the public. Citizen science may also be key to collecting data that would otherwise be unobtainable through traditional sources, such as measuring progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, despite myriad benefits, there has been limited legislative action taken to promote open and citizen science policies. The underlying issues are incentive systems which overemphasize publication in high impact, for-profit journals. The suggested policy solutions include: 1) creating an open database for citizen science projects, 2) restricting publishers from disadvantaging citizen science, and 3) incorporating open science in researcher evaluation.",https://www.sciencepolicyjournal.org/article_1038126_jspg210203.html,,2022,10.38126/JSPG210203,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,G86FXG96

A lack of data about GSI performance interferes with widespread adoption of GSI. A citizen science program that benefits researchers, lay scientists, and municipalities offers a way to provide these lacking data. We have developed an open-source, transferable green infrastructure rapid assessment (GIRA) protocol for studying the performance of GSI with citizen scientists. This protocol has been tested in six North American cities (New York City, Toronto, Vancouver, Chicago, San Francisco, and Buffalo). In this research we define the performance of GSI in varying geographic, climatic, and maintenance conditions with the intent to create technological, institutional, and management solutions to urban stormwater problems. The GIRA protocol was used by citizen scientists to assess the physical properties and capabilities of bioswales, while small, affordable Green Infrastructure Sensors Boxes (GIBoxes) were used to determine longer-term function across several rain events. Our results indicate that teams of citizen scientists can be effective for collecting and archiving widespread information on the post-installation function of GSI. The effort also showed that citizen scientists had changes in understanding of urban stormwater challenges and the role that GSI can play in solving these problems.

However, it is also highly heterogeneous, and learning happens in diverse ways, according to project tasks and participants’ activities. Therefore, we adopt a sociocultural view of learning, in which understanding learning requires a close analysis of the situation created both by the project tasks and the dynamics of engagement of the participants (volunteers, scientists, and others). To tackle the complexity of the field, this chapter maps learning in citizen science into six territories, according to               where               learning might take place: formal education (schools and universities); out-of-school education (science and nature clubs, summer camps, outdoor education, etc.); local and global communities (neighbourhood associations, activist associations, online communities, etc.); families; museums (science museums, art museums, zoos, and botanic gardens); and online citizen science. For each territory, we present key findings from the literature. The chapter also introduces our six personal journeys into the field of learning and citizen science, displaying their variety and the common lessons, challenges, and opportunities. Finally, we present four key tensions arising from citizen science projects in educational settings and look at training different stakeholders as a strategy to overcome some of these tensions.",https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-58278-4_15,,2021,,bookSection,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,SM4562CE

Through engagement with and coverage of open research outputs, journalists can help align the ideals of openness, transparency, and accountability with the wider public sphere and its democratic potential. Yet, it is unclear to what degree journalists use open research outputs in their reporting, what factors motivate or constrain this use, and how the recent surge in openly available research seen during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the relationship between open science and science journalism. This literature review thus examines journalists’ use of open research outputs, specifically open access publications and preprints. We focus on literature published from 2018 onwards—particularly literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic—but also include seminal articles outside the search dates. We find that, despite journalists’ potential to act as critical brokers of open access knowledge, their use of open research outputs is hampered by an overreliance on traditional criteria for evaluating scientific quality; concerns about the trustworthiness of open research outputs; and challenges using and verifying the findings. We also find that, while the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged journalists to explore open research outputs such as preprints, the extent to which these explorations will become established journalistic practices remains unclear. Furthermore, we note that current research is overwhelmingly authored and focused on the Global North, and the United States specifically. Finally, given the dearth of research in this area, we conclude with recommendations for future research that attend to issues of equity and diversity, and more explicitly examine the intersections of open science and science journalism.",https://f1000research.com/articles/12-512/v1,,2023,10.12688/f1000research.133710.1,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,Y5I4W6FW

Allen,"Science, Technology, & Human Values",,"This article draws insights from a case study examining unanswered health questions of residents in two polluted towns in an industrial region in southern France. A participatory health study, as conducted by the author, is presented as a way to address undone science by providing the residents with relevant data supporting their illness claims. Local residents were included in the health survey process, from the formulation of the questions to the final data analysis. Through this strongly participatory science (SPS) process, the townspeople offered many creative ideas in the final report for how the data could be used to assist in improving their health and environment and policy work is already in evidence, resulting from the study. Drawing from the literature on participatory science and expertise as well as from the initial outcomes of the local health study, I propose that SPS produces a form of knowledge justice. Understanding knowledge and its making as part of a social justice agenda aligns well with environmental justice frames. Through SPS, local residents have a hermeneutical resource to make sense of their embodied lives and augment their claims with strong data supporting actions for improving their health and environment.",http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243918758380,,2018,10.1177/0162243918758380,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,4DCCNBIZ

In particular, land represents a fundamental resource to address issues of climate change, biodiversity preservation, maintaining ecosystem services, and at the same time ensuring shared prosperity and well-being. Therefore, it is necessary to activate strategies to monitor changes in land use and land cover in order to evaluate strategies for proper management. To do this, the new open source geospatial analysis tools and the increasing availability of remote sensed open data can allow the activation of methodologies for monitoring changes in land use and land cover in order to provide data usable in other research areas or, for example, to implement a decision support system for environmental sustainability. In this study, a GIS approach based on open remote sensing data has been used to perform a spatial analysis of land cover changes within the Basilicata region (Southern Italy) that is spatially expeditious yet accurate. The results showed a very evident land transformation with important repercussions on the environmental components. The ease of use of techniques makes this methodology replicable in other territory and can be used as a preliminary approach to sustainable development model.",https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4672/1/4/18,,2021,10.3390/pollutants1040018,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,XXFDLMIM

In this sense, to address that challenge and facilitate and promote the discovery of scientific knowledge, the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles help organizations to share research data in a secure, appropriate, and useful way for other researchers.                                         Objective               The objective of this study was the FAIRification of existing health research data sets and applying a federated machine learning architecture on top of the FAIRified data sets of different health research performing organizations. The entire FAIR4Health solution was validated through the assessment of a federated model for real-time prediction of 30-day readmission risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).                                         Methods               The application of the FAIR principles on health research data sets in 3 different health care settings enabled a retrospective multicenter study for the development of specific federated machine learning models for the early prediction of 30-day readmission risk in patients with COPD. This predictive model was generated upon the FAIR4Health platform. Finally, an observational prospective study with 30 days follow-up was conducted in 2 health care centers from different countries. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used in both retrospective and prospective studies.                                         Results               Clinical validation was demonstrated through the implementation of federated machine learning models on top of the FAIRified data sets from different health research performing organizations. The federated model for predicting the 30-day hospital readmission risk was trained using retrospective data from 4.944 patients with COPD. The assessment of the predictive model was performed using the data of 100 recruited (22 from Spain and 78 from Serbia) out of 2070 observed (records viewed) patients during the observational prospective study, which was executed from April 2021 to September 2021. Significant accuracy (0.98) and precision (0.25) of the predictive model generated upon the FAIR4Health platform were observed. Therefore, the generated prediction of 30-day readmission risk was confirmed in 87% (87/100) of cases.                                         Conclusions               Implementing a FAIR data policy in health research performing organizations to facilitate data sharing and reuse is relevant and needed, following the discovery, access, integration, and analysis of health research data.

b3671d1d-e35f-41e3-aa8a-c31fff1f1f02,The Effect of Preregistration on Trust in Empirical Research Findings,Sarahanne Miranda Field;Eric-Jan Wagenmakers;Henk Kiers;Rink Hoekstra;Anja Franziska Ernst;Don Van Ravenzwaaij,,,"The crisis of confidence has played a primary role in undermining the trust researchers place in the findings of their peers, and our beliefs about the credibility of research results. Thus, the importance of increasing trust in credible reported research is paramount. Incentives such as preregistration are aimed at establishing a more trustworthy scientific literature, in that they help prevent various questionable research practices. As it stands, however, no empirical evidence exists demonstrating that preregistration does increase trust. Indeed, the objective merits of preregistration greatly lose in value if a researcher's subjective assessment of the value of preregistration does not align. Additionally, the picture may be complicated by a researcher's familiarity with the author of the study, regardless of the preregistration status of the research. The following proposal describes how we aim to test the extent to which preregistration increases the trust of participants in the reported outcomes. We also aim to assess how familiarity with another researcher might influence trust. We expect that preregistration increases researchers' trust in findings, relative to no preregistration, and that registered reporting increases trust more than preregistration alone. We also expect that familiarity enhances trust judgments to some extent, however we do not have specific expectations regarding the nature of this effect. We therefore include familiarity as an exploratory effect in our analyses.

In this paper, we discuss the significance of the practice of open science in generating social impact through policy decisions on day-to-day pandemic management when public institutions adopt WBE as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Further, we examine how open science helped communicate the importance and credibility of cutting-edge science to the public through continuous engagement using publicly available data, scientific communication interfaced through mass media, and information sharing via a live dashboard. Critical to the translation of science to policy was the philosophy of complete access to the entire knowledge generation process, results, and findings. We analyze the success of such an initiative in the city of Bengaluru in India amidst other academic studies in the country with regard to their translation to policy engagement. We posit that Bengaluru’s success may be due to the presence of an open science ethos, and multi-stakeholder inputs for knowledge creation and dissemination, leading to nuanced science communication which is empowering rather than patronizing. We further suggest policy-level recommendations for the incorporation of WBE as a public health surveillance tool and impress upon the interweaving of open science as part of scientific practice and its broader uptake by the policy ecosystem.",https://www.sciencepolicyjournal.org/article_1038126_jspg210207.html,,2022,10.38126/JSPG210207,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,RTAQHLHB

Also, by addition of altmetrics to the world scientific evaluation system it is less known how different research access channels such as OA publishing, PubMed indexing, and providing preprints in arXiv repository apply to altmetric indicators. In response, this paper investigated the case of WoS publications of Iran (2001-2012) for impact of mentioned publication availability models on citation, Mendeley readership, and tweet counts across four broader areas of research. Results suggested stronger impact of repository availability than OA on publication uptake. The findings on 98,453 articles show that gold OA papers (5%) did not benefit significantly more metric counts, except in tweets linking to OA medical publications. Articles in PubMed Central (3%) significantly advantaged the three investigated metrics, whereas arXiv preprints (2%) had higher readership advantage only. Different from PubMed publications, tweets to OA medical research did not significantly correlate with citations, suggesting that tweeting OA probably reflected aspect of impact different from formal citations. In Addition, OA publications only in life science and biomedicine were significantly read by Mendeley users in developed countries rather than developing ones.

More than half of the world’s Open Access articles are published according to this concept. However, a side effect of the model is that research is not published if researchers cannot pay the publication charge. The study examines the nature of this phenomenon, its extent, and implications. The study places a special focus on authors who are not affiliated with a research institution. The proportion of these authors is identified among 2,184 Danish authors in Danish periodicals in 2010. The possibility for poor researchers to receive compensation from publishers is investigated as well. Paying the APC is a problem for many researchers—represented by around 30% of authors who have published in Danish journals (unemployed scientists, students, as well as retired and private employees). Grants from publishers exist, but they are small and too uncertain to ensure that research is published optimally.

We surveyed volunteers in natural resource monitoring programs to determine whether they perceived changes in their environmental attitudes and decision-making. The majority of participants perceived changes in their attitude toward the resource being monitored, but not in their decision-making toward the resource they monitored or toward the environment more broadly. While the resources volunteers monitored in this study were diverse, program volunteers themselves were not. Participants were largely white, older, affluent, well-educated, held strong preexisting environmental attitudes, and were involved in other conservation, research, or management efforts. While engaging this narrow range of self-selected volunteers has the potential to reinforce existing pro-environmental attitudes through strengthening social networks, citizen science programs can increase their potential to promote attitude and behavioral change by making a concerted effort to engage a more diverse “citizenry.”",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12382,,2018,10.1111/conl.12382,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,IJ252RGX

This study sampled a thousand papers highly cited in the WOS, OA status and altmetrics of papers were collected through Unpaywall and PlumX. The collected data was analyzed as follows. Whether the OA affects the usage, capture, mention, and social media attention of the altmetrics was identified through a Mann–Whitney analysis, and was presented visually through a correspondence analysis. And then using factor analysis and correlation analysis, this study understand whether the article cited in an academic paper or bookmarked for reading showed a sensitive reaction to social media as well. Finally to understand the difference in altmetrics sensitivity of 10 LIS sub-subject topics, papers showing a high sensitivity for each of the 6 sources were selected, and a correspondence analysis was conducted on the relationship with the subject topics.

Second, views, blogs, and tweets showed greater sensitivity in open-access papers, and the number of Mendeley bookmark readers was the only source of altmetrics that had a significant correlation with citations.

Marshall,OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE,,"With approximately 40 percent of the world's population living within 100 km of the coast, it is critical that the ocean environment upon which these people depend be persistently monitored. Fortunately, coastal communities are ideally situated to take the leading role in this effort by leveraging their knowledge and understanding of the surrounding environment and by taking advantage of existing community infrastructure to support a range of complementary monitoring systems. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) operates ocean observatories on the west and east coasts of Canada and the Arctic and continuously gathers data in real-time for scientific research that helps communities, governments, and industry make informed decisions about the future. ONC is best known for its NEPTUNE and VENUS cabled observatories located off-shore southern British Columbia, and for the Oceans 2.0 data management system that supports ocean sensor health monitoring and troubleshooting, asset management, data capture, QA/QC, metadata, data delivery, data products, and web services. Building on the experience and expertise garnered from the installation and maintenance of VENUS and NEPTUNE, and on the data management foundation provided by Oceans 2.0, Ocean Networks Canada has advanced its capacity to monitor the ocean. ONC's world leading understanding of cabled community observatories and community-led monitoring programs leverages advancements in mobile oceanographic and meteorological instruments by making use of purpose-built mobile application software. The Cambridge Bay, NU observatory has provided a number of instrument manufacturers with opportunities to test and demonstrate their technologies under extreme Arctic conditions while simultaneously providing a wide range of persistent, real-time data to both the global science and local Arctic communities. Since the installation in 2012, the growing use of the Cambridge Bay observatory physical infrastructure and data has increased reliance on its continued successful operation and increased demand on its capabilities. In fact, support for this particular community observatory continues to grow with Cambridge Bay residents providing logistic assistance for observatory maintenance, participating in outreach and formal learning activities, and, more recently, collecting critical, winter-time data on snow depth and ice thickness. Its success enabled the expansion of a number of community observatories across the BC coast, as part of ONC's Smart Ocean SystemsTM program. Meanwhile, data collected by community members themselves (commonly referred to as “citizen science”) is a concept that continues to evolve with changing technology, data demands, and collection techniques. This method has remarkable potential in coastal communities, as the people who live there are, without question, the best suited to be collecting data in the field. Their understanding of the local environment and the risks and challenges of working in their unique coastal environments remains unparalleled, allowing them to capture critical data in a relatively large area through all of the seasons. Moreover, Arctic research is estimated to cost eight-times that of work in temperate regions [1]. A community approach tends to be cost effective by taking advantage of local resources, providing an often-overlooked connection between the data and the people it affects the most, and it has the potential to integrate local and traditional knowledge into the decision-making process. Mature citizen science programs, such as those being supported and co-developed by ONC, endeavor to leverage this community knowledge and to pair it with the funds and person time needed to supply the equipment and training to a population that is extremely capable and willing. This contribution will discuss the range of technologies and instrumentation used in ONC's community observatories and citizen science programs. It will also present the relationship between the communities, the technology, and the data that are produced.",,,2019,10.23919/OCEANS40490.2019.8962781,conferencePaper,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,CLEHLPW3

In this paper, we assess the impact of participation in a biodiversity citizen science project (the Spipoll, dedicated to pollinators' monitoring) through the analysis of online interactions within the program's data sharing platform. By drawing on a previous qualitative analysis of the comments exchanged by the participants within this platform, we focus on those comments which share items on aspects of biology and ecology related to the Spipoll program. This sample gathers 2009 comments from 2010 to 2018. We first classified the different constitutive elements from these comments into seven categories following the topics they deal with. We then studied the temporal change in occurrence of each of these topics from 2010 to 2018. We show that long-term participation is associated with the growing expression of scientific procedural skills: formulation of hypothesis and explanation, proposition of new research questions. To our knowledge, our study is the first one that detects the acquisition of such procedural skills in biodiversity citizen science.

Morrison;Wellsley Costello;Christian Williams,Continental Shelf Research,,"The New Hampshire (NH) Volunteer Beach Profile Monitoring Program (VBPMP) was developed as a partnership between University of New Hampshire scientists, community volunteers through the Coastal Research Volunteer program, the NH Coastal Program, and the NH Geological Survey. The program addresses multiple needs including building a robust dataset to understand beach erosion and accretion trends on the New Hampshire Atlantic Coast and developing the capacity to maintain the program over an extended period (years). Also, very important to the program is the engagement of local and regional residents in the study as partners and sharing the results to increase awareness of coastal issues to inform coastal management. Starting in December 2016, three profile stations were established at three NH beaches to train volunteers and establish the monitoring program. In January 2018, the number of profile stations was expanded to thirteen, increasing coverage to six major beaches.. Analysis of the beach profile database focuses on the period from January 2018 to October 2021. As expected, NH beaches showed seasonal variations with erosion in winter followed by extended accretional periods. The beaches were significantly eroded during a series of severe nor'easters in March 2018. For example, Hampton Beach experienced up to ∼1.4 m of vertical erosion and ∼30 m of berm retreat. An unexpected result from this study was the large differences in the mean elevations between the beaches based on the elevation profiles. The lower elevation beaches were far more susceptible to storm flooding, erosion, and damage to infrastructure. In addition to greater capacity for data collection toward decision-making, adopting a citizen science approach resulted in benefits to community and academic partners, such as improved methods, varied perspectives, increased knowledge about coastal processes and climate threats, connection to place, and motivation to take action.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434322000875,,2022,10.1016/j.csr.2022.104733,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,CJJBSBZF

Hadjichambis;Anastasia Adamou;Yiannis Georgiou,Educational Research Review,,"Environmental Citizen Science (CS) initiatives have been largely embraced in K-12 education, as they are often hypothesized to improve students' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviours to act as “environmental citizens” according to the notion of Environmental Citizenship (EC). However, the potential of environmental CS initiatives to promote Education for Environmental Citizenship (EEC) has not been systematically explored. At the same time, environmental CS initiatives for educational purposes are highly heterogenous and learning is enacted in diverse ways, according to the participatory and the pedagogical components underpinning each initiative. To address the complexity of the field, this review study adopts the PRISMA methodology to synthesize thirty-four empirical studies (n = 34) retrieved from a systematic review of the literature covering the last two decades (2000–2020). The reviewed environmental CS initiatives were subjected to a content analysis to identify their impact on students' EC (e.g., EC competences, actions, outcomes), as well as to unveil the CS initiatives' constitutional components in terms of (a) Participation (e.g., types of students' contributions, level of data collection, frequency of students' participation, modes of student engagement, forms of students’ involvement), and (b) Pedagogy (e.g., learning goals, educational contexts, learning mechanisms, EEC pedagogy). Our analysis shed light to the three territories (Participation, Pedagogy, Environmental Citizenship) underpinning the reviewed CS initiatives as well as to their interrelations. We reflect on these findings, and we provide directions for future research to guide the development of more successful environmental CS initiatives in K-12 education, serving as a vehicle for EC.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X23000180,,2023,10.1016/j.edurev.2023.100525,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,E6Q4BZZI

This obvious fact has major implications for how the publishing industry will be modified in the foreseeable future. This change may be technologically driven but there is a place for intellectual debate about the appropriate regulation of the field. This requires an examination of the commercial and moral claims of the authors or creators and the conventional publishers vis a vis those of the end users both nationally and internationally. This analysis will enable me to make an argument about the importance of open access as an appropriate governance mechanism for both protection and distribution of information in the international arena. In addition, this paper argues that in a globalized world justice and social cohesion requires commercial Multinational corporations (MNCs) to act responsibly and ethically. Most of the big publishing houses are such MNCs and if open access repositories (OARs) are to be relevant such publishing houses will have to embrace the concept. Overall, I will use the concept of corporate social responsibility to make the argument that it is logical and feasible that publishing MNCs can modify their business practices and adopt OARs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12109-015-9403-x,,2015,10.1007/s12109-015-9403-x,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,6NN2QIRR

Oberhauser,Biological Conservation,,"Nature-based citizen science projects can educate their volunteers about conservation issues and encourage them to engage in conservation actions. Theory and previous research suggest that knowledge of issues and action strategies, as well as social factors can influence the decision to take action on a given issue. To determine the extent to which volunteers are receiving information and support through their citizen science projects that could increase their engagement in conservation, we surveyed participants from butterfly citizen science projects across the United States. We asked volunteers if they received information on butterfly conservation threats and action strategies, if they were actively encouraged to engage in conservation, if their project provided a sense of connection and community that supported engagement in conservation, and how their engagement in 12 different conservation actions, ranging from planting host plants to contacting the media about butterfly conservation, has changed since joining citizen science. 79% of our respondents reported that they have received information on butterfly conservation from their citizen science project, and 55% felt that their project actively encouraged them to engage in conservation. 95% of respondents reported that they had increased their involvement in butterfly conservation. Notably, volunteers who received information on conservation and who were encouraged to engage in conservation by their citizen science project were more likely to have increased their engagement in conservation. Connection to other volunteers was also linked to increased conservation action. We make recommendations for how citizen science projects can improve their programming to increase conservation engagement.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715300367,,2017,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.07.029,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,P85VR75R

This study applies machine learning methods to explore the possibility of identifying WDPs and to investigate the influence mechanisms of literature-related and social media-related features. A pre-task was first conducted to investigate whether the visibility of scientific papers on social media can be predicted, and the role of various features was analyzed. Then, we defined two predictive tasks for identifying WDPs before and after they are visible on social media. The performance of eight state-of-the-art algorithms was compared in three experiments against the dataset of the oncology field, and the contribution of literature-related and social media-related features in the tasks was explained based on the Shapley additional explanations (SHAP) value. The results show that XGBoost performs better than other algorithms, especially with an F1 score of 0.988 and AUC of 0.998 in the trend prediction task. Nearly all of the literature-related features have great effects on identifying long-term disseminated papers, and most social media-related features play more significant roles in identifying broadly mentioned papers. Moreover, journal features contribute more to identifying papers of social media visibility, while paper features, especially research topics, have a greater influence on identifying WDPs. The number and proportion of academic-related Twitter users have great impacts on the scale and duration of papers’ dissemination. The number and duration of first-generation tweets play critical roles in identifying broadly mentioned and long-term disseminated papers, respectively. This study provides profound insights into the influencing factors in the dissemination of papers from the scientific community to and across social media, and helps to understand the difference in knowledge propagation between academia and the public.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645732200067X,,2022,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102945,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,WX9GC8Y4

However, it is not clear how different entities benefit from the Open Access advantage; because, the recognition process is dominated by some psychological or realistic biases, resulting in an unequal distribution of citations between different entities. The biases may be exacerbated in Open Access world, e.g. due to the scientists uncertainty about the quality of Open Access materials, or quantitatively or qualitatively unequal presence of countries. Consequently, although, Open Access is able to achieve their potential citations, it is not unlikely that it increases the inequalities, depriving the already “have-nots”. Trying to illuminate how countries are benefiting from Open Access advantage, this study compares citation performances of the world’s countries in two journal sets, i.e. Open Access and non Open Access journals. The results of the analyses conducted at subject field level show that overall recognition gap between developed and less-developed blocks is widened by publishing in Open Access journals. The verification of individual countries’ performances confirms the finding by revealing that open-access-advantaged nations are mainly consisted of developed ones. However, some open-access-advantaged instances are from the less-developed block, which may promisingly suggest early heralds of Open Access potentialities to achieve the recognition of “lost sciences”, leading to relative reparation of the gap in future.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-007-1890-x,,2008,10.1007/s11192-007-1890-x,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,4VA8YWAI

Cost-cutting pragmatism aside, the recruitment of volunteers into diverse roles within conservation organisations also responds to growing public concern for the environment and demand for ‘meaningful’ engagement in people's pastime. Here we argue that this auspicious premise of a win-win transaction fails to acknowledge a range of emerging ethical issues regarding the management of unpaid workers. This lack of critical examination frustrates the development of solutions that are effective for conservation and fair to volunteers. We focus our attention on three archetypal cases—citizen science, voluntourism and unpaid internships—to highlight the complex and value-laden trade-offs that need to be negotiated to ethically manage unpaid work in conservation. We identify opportunities to redress the balance between volunteer needs and conservation goals. Ultimately, we hope to stimulate further, more open debate on the effective and fair use of the available labour force in conservation.",https://journals.lww.com/coas/fulltext/2020/18040/a_reflection_on_the_fair_use_of_unpaid_work_in.8.aspx,,2020,10.4103/cs.cs_19_163,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,EB5ZJVYZ

Citation counts were extracted from Web of Science and Scopus, and AAS was harvested from the Altmetric Explorer. Multivariable general linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between OA and citation count, as well as between OA and AAS. Results Among the 755 included articles, 309 (40.9%) were freely available online. Among the 309 OA articles, articles available from publishers accounted for 64.4% (199/309) of all OA articles, and those available through self-archiving accounted for 56.0% (173/309).

Third, an evaluation indicator system of OA journals from two dimensions of academic influence and societal influence is constructed too. Lastly, through normalization, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, validity analysis, factor analysis and two-dimensional analysis, the academic and societal influence of OA journals are evaluated and compared between China and USA. It is found that in terms of academic influence and societal influence, the evaluation scores of international OA journals are quite different between China and USA. The influence of the USA is far greater than that of China. The results show a strong positive correlation among the 7 traditional citation indicators based on JCR, and a high positive correlation among the 8 altmetrics indicators based on Altmetrics Explorer, and the indicators have a significant consistency both overall and internal. There is a highly positive correlation between academic influence and societal influence scores for the Chinese and American OA journals.

Critical attention to data is also proliferating, exposing the diverse ways that data produces inequality of opportunity and harm in society. This paper draws the nascent field of critical data studies into conversation with emerging narratives in data-for-development (D4D) to advance the conceptualization of data inequalities, explaining how they both align with and diverge from core tropes of digital inequalities research – and why this matters for development. The paper examines the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to three ‘data divides’ – access to data, representation of the world as data, and control over data flows – through examples of digital identity systems and national data infrastructures, user-generated data, and personal behavioral data produced through corporate platforms. This understanding provides a basis for future research, practice, and policymaking on data-related (in)equalities in development contexts and beyond.",,,2019,10.1080/02681102.2019.1650244,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,BEI5JDLF

A Study to Compare Assessment Methods,Ruth Cronje;Spencer Rohlinger;Alycia Crall;Newman Greg,Applied Environmental Education & Communication,,"This study investigated the use of a contextually sensitive instrument to assess the effect of invasive species monitoring training on the scientific literacy of citizen volunteers. The authors measured scientific literacy scores before and after 57 citizens participated in a 2-day event to learn to monitor invasive species with an instrument including 1 general-measures (Science and Engineering Indicator [SEI]) item and 4 newly developed contextual items. Ninety control subjects were also tested with a mailed survey that included the SEI item and the contextual items. Control scores, compared with trainees’ pretest scores with the chi-square (SEI) and independent-samples t-test (contextual), did not differ significantly from the pretest scores of trainees on either the SEI (p = .68) or the contextual (p = .11) items. The authors compared trainees’ pretest scores with their posttest scores using McNemar's chi-square (SEI) and a paired-samples t-test (contextual). Posttest scores on the SEI item were not significantly (p = .52) different from pretest scores. However, posttest scores on the contextual instrument were significantly (p = .007) higher than those on the pretest. The authors’ multi-item context-sensitive instrument detected significant science literacy gains that were not detected by the single generalized SEI item. Multi-item contextual instruments may offer a promising, feasible approach for the development of new instruments to assess the effect of training in invasive species monitoring, and possibly other types of citizen science programs, on the scientific literacy of citizen scientists.",,,2011,10.1080/1533015X.2011.603611,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,TT87UTM3

Transparency and accountability interventions on the mobile geoweb,P.Y (Yola) Georgiadou;Juma Lungo;C Richter,International Journal of Digital Earth,,"Transparency and Accountability (T&A) interventions are emergent social technologies in middle and low-income countries. They bring together citizen sensors, mobile communications, geo-browsers and social organization to raise public awareness on the extent of governance deficits, and monitor government's (in) action. Due to their novelty, almost all we know about the effectiveness of T&A interventions comes from gray literature. Can citizen sensors radically increase the transparency of the state, or are changes brought about by T&A interventions more likely to be incremental? We review the literature on transparency policies and describe their drivers, characteristics and supply - demand dynamics. We discuss promising cases of T&A interventions in East Africa, the empirical focus of an on-going collaborative research program. We conclude that the effect of T&A interventions is more likely to be incremental and mediated by existing organizations and professional users who populate the space between the state and citizens. Two elements at the interface between supply and demand seem rather crucial for designers of T&A interventions: accountability-relevant data and extreme publics.",,,2013,10.1080/17538947.2013.782073,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,5B9EFCSR
8b622884-5681-495f-8ab5-682695626329,Open science initiatives: challenges for public health promotion,Cheryl Holzmeyer,Health Promotion International,,"Summary             While academic open access, open data and open science initiatives have proliferated in recent years, facilitating new research resources for health promotion, open initiatives are not one-size-fits-all. Health research particularly illustrates how open initiatives may serve various interests and ends. Open initiatives not only foster new pathways of research access; they also discipline research in new ways, especially when associated with new regimes of research use and peer review, while participating in innovation ecosystems that often perpetuate existing systemic biases toward commercial biomedicine. Currently, many open initiatives are more oriented toward biomedical research paradigms than paradigms associated with public health promotion, such as social determinants of health research. Moreover, open initiatives too often dovetail with, rather than challenge, neoliberal policy paradigms. Such initiatives are unlikely to transform existing health research landscapes and redress health inequities. In this context, attunement to social determinants of health research and community-based local knowledge is vital to orient open initiatives toward public health promotion and health equity. Such an approach calls for discourses, norms and innovation ecosystems that contest neoliberal policy frameworks and foster upstream interventions to promote health, beyond biomedical paradigms. This analysis highlights challenges and possibilities for leveraging open initiatives on behalf of a wider range of health research stakeholders, while emphasizing public health promotion, health equity and social justice as benchmarks of transformation.",https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/34/3/624/4924390,,2019,10.1093/heapro/day002,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,ACTPAIV8

Two linear mixed-effects models tested the effects of OA status on citation counts and altmetric scores of manuscripts.Results: Gold OA was associated with significantly higher altmetric scores (p < .001) but only marginally higher citation counts (p = .057) compared to closed access manuscripts. No significant differences in citation counts or altmetric scores were observed between green OA and closed access manuscripts.Discussion: CSD research that is fully open receives more online attention and slightly more scientific attention than research that is paywalled or available through alternative OA routes like self-archiving. Additional research is needed to understand secondary variables affecting these and other scholarly and societal metrics of impact across studies in CSD. Ongoing support and incentives to reduce the inequities of OA publishing are critical for continued scientific advancement.",,,2022,,book,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,HZHPYLBV

It can be seen as a win-win situation, where scientists get help from the public and the participants get a public engagement experience that involves them in real and meaningful scientific research. In this paper we present the results of a series of qualitative interviews with scientists who participated in the 'OPAL' portfolio of citizen science projects that has been running in England since 2007: What were their experiences of participating in citizen science? We highlight two particular sets of issues that our participants have voiced, methodological/epistemological and ethical issues. While we share the general enthusiasm over citizen science, we hope that the research in this paper opens up more debate over the potential pitfalls of citizen science as seen by the scientists themselves.",,,2013,10.1177/0963662513497324,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,D9ZEC5H7

Conservation attitudes and behaviors largely depend on experiences with nature, and this ""extinction of experience"" (EOE) is a threat to biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we propose that citizen science, an increasingly popular way to integrate public outreach with data collection, can potentially mitigate EOE. Our review of the literature on volunteers' motivations and/or outcomes indicates that nature-based citizen science (NBCS) fosters cognitive and emotional aspects of experiences in nature. Although these experiences can change participants' behaviors and attitudes toward the natural world, this field remains largely unstudied. As such, even though NBCS can complement efforts to increase opportunities for people to interact with nature, further research on the mechanisms that drive this relationship is needed to strengthen our understanding of various outcomes of citizen science.",,,2018,10.1002/fee.1826,journalArticle,,,2023-08-21 10:50:35,e8336267-2d0e-43e0-94d8-e0f0b513b58e,test2,48XRQUX2
