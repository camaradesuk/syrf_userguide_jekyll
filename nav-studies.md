# Studies

## All Studies - All Users
Under the 'All Studies' tab, you can see the [bibliographic data](../bibliographic.html) of all the studies uploaded to a project. 


## Study Management - Administrators only
This page has three main sections related to:
- Systematic Searches
- Risk of Bias Assessment
- Jobs table

## Systematic Searches
In this section you can:
- Upload a new Systematic Search
- Update studies using a CSV file
- Start Risk of Bias assessment on your searches
- View studies related to a search
- Delete a search
- Copy a search ID

In the Systematic Searches table you can see the statuses of the Systematic Search upload processes.
The Uploading, Processing and Parsing statuses are clickable.
The clickable statuses are indicated with an animation.
Clicking on the status will direct you to the last table on the page, where more information is given about the upload process.
This table does not show any systematic search uploads that have errored.
The errored uploads can be viewed in the last table on this page, with detailed error information.

To start the upload click the "Upload New Systematic Search" button and follow the instructions in the dialog box.

To delete a systematic search from your project, locate the search in the table and click on the red delete button (trash icon) in the Actions column, next to the View Studies button. This action cannot be undone. This will remove the systematic search from this project and all screenings, annotations and outcome data for studies in this search will be lost.

The Bulk Study Update feature's button is now located near the Upload New Systematic Search button.
