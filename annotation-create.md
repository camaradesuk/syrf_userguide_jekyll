# Creating annotation questions
In your systematic review protocol, you will have specified certain information you want to extract from each of your studies, such as 'Were animals randomised to experimental groups?' or 'What concentration of drug treatment was used?'. In SyRF you can annotate your studies with this information using annotation questions.

To design annotation questions for a stage of your project, go to 'Question Design' under 'Project Settings' on the left-hand navigation bar of your project.

## Question editing
At present, questions can only be added or deleted. Individual questions cannot be edited or changed order. This is primarility due to our database structure and questions and an editing feature will be implemented in an upcoming release.
