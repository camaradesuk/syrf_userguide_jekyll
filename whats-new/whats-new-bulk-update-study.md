# New Feature: Bulk Study Update

We're excited to introduce the **Bulk Study Update** feature, a new tool for Project Administrators!

This powerful function allows you to efficiently modify key information for multiple existing studies within your project simultaneously. Using a simple CSV upload, you can now update:

* **PDF Relative Paths:** Easily add or correct links to full-text PDFs, especially useful after an initial screening phase.
* **Custom IDs:** Update your internal identifiers across several studies at once.
* **Screening Decisions:** Import screening decisions made outside of SyRF (or correct existing ones) and map them precisely to the relevant screener and screening stage (e.g., Title/Abstract, Full Text).

*Access the Bulk Study Update feature from the 'All Studies' page.*

This feature addresses common requests, making it easier to manage study data dynamically after the initial upload, particularly for linking PDFs in multi-stage reviews and integrating external screening work.

For detailed instructions on how to prepare your CSV file and use the feature, please see the [**Bulk Study Update section in the main guide**](../systematic-search.html#51-using-the-bulk-study-update-feature).
