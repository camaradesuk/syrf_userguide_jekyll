# Contact Form

We have added a new way of contacting us. Sending us an email is no longer required; questions can be submitted directly to the [Contact Form](../contact-us.html). 

To access the form click on "Help" at the top right corner &rarr; "Contact Us".

Users now have the ability to: 

* Ask either a Support Request, for questions related to a specific project, or a General Inquiry, for general questions
* Can input all details related to the question directly into the form.
