# Updated: Enhanced Study Management Interface

We've unified the management of studies in your SyRF project in the **Study Management** interface. 

The updated interface now features three main sections:

* **Systematic Searches Table:** Your primary workspace where you can upload a new systematic search, bulk update existing studies including updating screening decisions and adding PDF relative links, initiate automated risk of bias assessment, and view and delete systematic searches from your project.

* **Risk of Bias Assessment:** Dedicated section for tracking Risk of Bias assessment processes with detailed progress reporting and comprehensive error reporting.

* **Job Progress Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of all background processes including Systematic Search Uploads and Bulk Study Updates.


### Key Improvements:

* **Better Visual Hierarchy:** Clearer section organisation with improved navigation and status indicators
* **Enhanced Status Tracking:** More detailed upload progress with clickable status indicators that provide comprehensive progress information
* **Streamlined Actions:** All study management actions now logically grouped with intuitive access points
* **Improved Error Display:** Detailed error dialogues help troubleshoot issues more effectively

### Documentation Updates:

We've also completely restructured our Study Management documentation to match the new interface:

* **Comprehensive Study Management Guide:** A new, detailed guide covering all aspects of study management in one place
* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Enhanced guides with screenshots for every major function

For complete instructions on using the enhanced Study Management interface, see our comprehensive [**Study Management Guide**](../study-management.html).

This update represents our commitment to making study management more intuitive and efficient for systematic review teams!
