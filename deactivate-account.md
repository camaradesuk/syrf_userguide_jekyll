# Deactivate Your Account

SyRF users can deactivate their account at any time in their account settings.

## What Happens When You Deactivate Your Account?

### Your Personal Data
- We will NOT delete any of your data. You can re-activate your account by signing in again.
- We will continue to retain your personal data (i.e. email address and name) to allow you to re-activate your account if and when you choose to.

### Communications
- Deactivated accounts will NOT receive any emails from SyRF.
- If you have contributed to a SyRF project, it is your responsibility to make sure the project admin has an email which they can use to contact you. Failure to do so may mean that you will not receive credit or be notified of any publications that you have contributed data to.

### Contributions to SyRF Projects
- We will NOT delete any of your contributions to SyRF Projects (e.g. screening decisions or annotations).
