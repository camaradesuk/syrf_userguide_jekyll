# Project Details
You can see an overview of the project on the Project Details page. 

In the centre of the page, you will see a screening stage with the inclusion and exclusion criteria that were added by the Project Administrator during project creation. Click the 'Review' button to enter a stage. If you are a Project Administrator, you will be able to add new stages there too. 

On the right hand side of the Project Overview page you can see:

* **Contact** - the contact email of the project administrator
* **Protocol url** - a link to where the systematic review protocol has been published
* **Keywords** - any keywords assigned to the project
* **Systematic searches** - details of studies added to the project
* **Project visibility** - either public or private
* **Creation date** - the date the project was made
* **Members** - a list of members on the project

Project Details can be edited by clicking on the cog icons next to each heading.
