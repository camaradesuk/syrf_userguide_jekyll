# Managing Study References with Systematic Searches

This guide walks you through managing literature search results within your SyRF project. In SyRF, references identified from your searches (e.g., from databases like PubMed, Embase, Scopus) are grouped and uploaded as units called **Systematic Searches**.

## Overview of the Process

The systematic search upload process involves several key steps:

* **[Preparing References](prepare-references.html):** Includes crucial deduplication steps and choosing the correct file format (EndNote XML or CSV), detailing the required fields.
* **[Uploading](upload-search.html):** How to add your prepared Systematic Search file to your SyRF project.
* **[Managing Full-Text PDFs](manage-pdfs.html):** Explains how to link references to their PDFs using relative paths, best practices for file naming, and the process for providing the actual PDF files to the SyRF team.
* **[Viewing Studies](view-studies.html):** How to view your uploaded studies after successful import.
* **[Managing Studies Post-Upload](manage-studies.html):** Covers how to modify existing study data (including PDF paths, custom IDs, and screening decisions) using the Bulk Update feature, and how to delete entire Systematic Searches if necessary.

A project can contain multiple Systematic Searches, allowing you to manage results from different search strategies or updates over time.
