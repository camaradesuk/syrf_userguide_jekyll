# Join a Project

In your account under Project Listings there are three tabs: *My Projects,* *Pending Projects* and *Other Projects*.  

**My Projects** lists all projects you are a member of. 

**Pending Projects** lists all projects you have pending requests to join and your pending invitations to projects. 

**Other Projects** lists all other Public projects [Read more under Visibility & Access](../nav-project-settings.html)


There are two types of project access, a project can require administrator approval to join, or not.
