You can create new projects via the Projects tab. Enter your project details in the pop-up form that appears.

As part of project creation, you will be asked to specify the inclusion/exclusion criteria for your project. These should be pre-specified in your protocol.

Once you have created your project, you can keep track of your project progress through the Project Details Page on the right-hand side of your screen.

You will automatically be assigned a Project Administrator role in any project that you create.

## Projects with Multiple Screening Criteria

Currently, you can only have one set of inclusion/exclusion critiera per SyRF project. If you wish to have multiple screening stages in your systematic review, for instance title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening, you can do this by exporting your included studies from SyRF following your first screening stage and uploading them to a new SyRF project to complete your second screening stage.


## Public and Private Projects 

When you create a SyRF project you can make it public or private. 

![alttext](figs/Fig_create_project.png)

The names and descriptions of public projects are visible to all other SyRF users. Private projects are hidden from public project listings. Project visibility can be adjusted later in [Project Settings](../nav-project-settings.html) by going to *Project Settings> General> Visibility* and enable or disable ‘Public Project’.
