# Project settings
Only Project Administators are able to edit project settings.

## General settings
In the general project settings, Project Administrators can edit:

* Project name
* Project description
* Project visibility
* Contact email
* Protocol Url
* Keywords

### Deleting projects
Projects can be deleted from the general settings. Please know that data from deleted projects cannot be recovered.

## Members & groups
Project Administrators can change user roles in the members & groups settings page. To make a user a Project Administrator, click the checkbox next to their name. Uncheck the box to make them a Reviewer. Changes are saved automatically.

## Systematic searches
Project Administrators can view the systematic searches that have previously been uploaded, or upload new systematic searches on this page. For more information, go to [Section 7](https://camaradesuk.github.io/syrf_userguide/systematicSearch.html).

## Question design
Project Administrators can add and delete annotation questions in their project on this page. These questions can be then assigned to annotation stages. For more information, go to [Section 10](https://camaradesuk.github.io/syrf_userguide/projectannotation.html).

## Stage settings
In the stage settings, Project Administrators can add and edit stages.

You can decide which elements to add to your stage, e.g. screening, annotation and/or data extraction. If you choose both screening and annotation, you will be asked to choose how to combine these tasks. Specifically, the options are:
	- All studies require screening, but annotation is optional
	- All studies require annotation, but screening is optional
	- All studies require both screening and annotation

### Annotation question selection
Project Administators can select which questions they have created in the Question Design settings page to add to each stage. Click the 'Edit project questions' button to return to the question design page.
