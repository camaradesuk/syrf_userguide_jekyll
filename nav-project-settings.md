## Systematic Searches
Project Administrators can view the systematic searches that have previously been uploaded, or upload new systematic searches on this page. For more information, go to [Systematic Search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link systematic-search.md %}).

## Question Design
Project Administrators can add and delete annotation questions in their project on this page. These questions can be then assigned to annotation stages. For more information, go to [Annotation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link annotation.md %}).

## Stage Settings
In the stage settings, Project Administrators can add and edit stages.

You can decide which elements to add to your stage, e.g. screening, annotation and/or data extraction. If you choose both screening and annotation, you will be asked to choose how to combine these tasks. Specifically, the options are:
	- All studies require screening, but annotation is optional
	- All studies require annotation, but screening is optional
	- All studies require both screening and annotation

### Annotation Question Selection
Project Administators can select which questions they have created in the Question Design settings page to add to each stage. Click the 'Edit project questions' button to return to the question design page.
