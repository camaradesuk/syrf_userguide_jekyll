# Quantitative Data Export & Updates

We have updated SyRF's data export functionality and updated the formatting. 
The following updates are of particular note to project administrators: 



* __Updated field:__ Screening data - we have added new field "DateTimeOfScreening". [Read more about Data Dictionaries](../data-export/data-dictionary/data-dictionary.html).
* __Updated field:__ Annotation data - for each annotation, now the "DateTimeAnnotated" is exported. This represents the date the annotation was made by a given user. [Read more about Data Dictionaries](../data-export/data-dictionary/data-dictionary.html).
* __New feature:__ Quantitative data export is now available.  [Read more about Quantitative Data Export](../data-export/quantitative.html). 
* All dates in file exports are given in ISO format (International Standards Organisation). Please note, your local Excel settings may impact how this is displayed. [Read more about Data Dictionaries](../data-export/data-dictionary/data-dictionary.html).
