Oyama;A. Watanabe;T. Sasaki;M. Sakaguchi;H. Mochizuki;K. Kitagawa,Stroke,Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leptomeningeal collateral growth is a key factor that defines the severity of ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke generally have vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus; however, consensus is lacking on how diabetes mellitus affects leptomeningeal arteriogenesis. We investigate the influence of diabetes mellitus on the leptomeningeal arteriogenesis. METHODS: We measured the vessel diameter of the leptomeningeal anastomoses 14 days after the common carotid artery occlusion in db/db, db/+, and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice. In another set of these mice, we measured the infarct volume attributed to subsequent middle cerebral artery occlusion 14 days after the common carotid artery occlusion. Mac-2-positive cells on the dorsal brain surface and the mRNA expression of several macrophage-related factors in the cerebral cortex were examined. Finally, we tested whether the leptomeningeal arteriogenesis could be restored by pharmaceutical intervention in the db/db mice. RESULTS: Cerebral hypoperfusion led to significant ipsilateral leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/+ mice and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice. The collateral growth contributed to reduced infarct volume. In contrast, leptomeningeal arteriogenesis was impaired in the db/db mice. The number of Mac-2-positive cells was increased and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression was induced after common carotid artery occlusion in the db/+ mice. However, these responses were not observed in the db/db mice. Administration of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor etanercept before common carotid artery occlusion restored the hypoperfusion-induced leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/db mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that leptomeningeal arteriogenesis is impaired in db/db mice and that suppression of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha response to hypoperfusion is the major contributing factor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25922509,"From the Department of Neurology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan (T.Y., Y.S., N.O., A.W., T.S., M.S., H.M.); Department of Stroke Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan (Y.Y.); and Department of Neurology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan (K.K.). yukami@neurol.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.",2015,10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008062,Journal Article,"Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology;Carotid Artery Diseases/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology;Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology;Etanercept;Hyperglycemia/blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology;Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology;Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/*blood/drug therapy/genetics;Mice;Mice, Mutant Strains;*Neovascularization, Physiologic;Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood/genetics;animal models;collateral circulation;diabetes mellitus;tumor necrosis factor-alpha",path/to/pdf,10/02/2019 14:53:58,036dfca2-347c-438a-a457-010acc81ec5f,Included studies,
