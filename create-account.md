# Create an Account

You will need to create a free account to create or participate in projects.

[To Create a new SyRF account, click here.](https://syrf.org.uk)

Creating an account allows us to keep your data secure and allows the administrator of each project to see who has access to the project data. Read our [Data Management and Sharing Policy here](https://auth.syrf.org.uk/Privacy).

[**I donâ€™t see an email in my inbox from SyRF**](https://syrf.org.uk/faq)

Once you have created an account and logged in you can access public projects or create a new project via the Projects tab in SyRF.
