# Create an Account

You will need to create a [free SyRF account](https://syrf.org.uk) to create or participate in projects. You can also sign in using Google.

Creating an account allows us to keep your data secure and allows the administrator of each project to see who has access to the project data. Read our [Data Management and Sharing Policy here](https://syrf.org.uk/privacy).

Once you have created an account and logged in you can access public projects or create a new project via the Projects tab in SyRF.
