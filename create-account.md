Creating an account allows us to keep your data secure and allows the administrator of each project to see who has access to the project data. Read our [Data Management and Sharing Policy here](https://syrf.org.uk/about/privacy).

Once you have created an account and logged in you can access public projects or create a new project via the Projects tab in SyRF.
